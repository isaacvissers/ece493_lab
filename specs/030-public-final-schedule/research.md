# Research: Public Final Schedule Announcement

## Decision: Public schedule content fields

**Decision**: Include paper titles, authors, and abstracts only.
**Rationale**: Provides sufficient detail for planning while keeping public exposure constrained to approved fields.
**Alternatives considered**: Titles-only; titles + authors.

## Decision: Public access policy

**Decision**: Schedule is fully public (no attendee authentication required).
**Rationale**: Public planning benefit and aligns with UC-30 default public access expectation.
**Alternatives considered**: Attendee-authenticated; mixed access.

## Decision: Update visibility

**Decision**: Show “Last updated” timestamp on public schedule updates.
**Rationale**: Minimal transparency without the overhead of full version history.
**Alternatives considered**: Public changelog; no timestamping.
