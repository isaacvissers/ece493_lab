**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, consistency, and coverage of public schedule requirements before implementation
**Created**: 2026-02-03
**Feature**: /home/ivissers/ece_493/labs/lab2/lab2/specs/030-public-final-schedule/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are public schedule publication requirements explicitly defined? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [x] CHK002 Are schedule entry display dimensions (day/time/room/session) explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002]
- [x] CHK003 Are pending-state behaviors defined for pre-publication access? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [x] CHK004 Are publication failure behaviors defined to prevent partial/broken public exposure? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [x] CHK005 Are rendering failure behaviors defined with friendly public messaging? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005]
- [x] CHK006 Are unscheduled item behaviors explicitly defined (label vs omit)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK007 Is “readable and consistent across listings” quantified or clarified with objective criteria? [Clarity, Spec §FR-008]
- [x] CHK008 Is “schedule announcement content on the CMS landing page or dedicated page” unambiguous about placement and linkage? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009]
- [x] CHK009 Is the exact public content field set (titles/authors/abstracts only) stated without ambiguity? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]
- [x] CHK010 Is the “Last updated” timestamp requirement precise about where it appears? [Clarity, Spec §FR-012]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK011 Do access-policy requirements align with the assumption of fully public access? [Consistency, Spec §FR-011, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK012 Do edge-case statements align with FR-003/FR-004/FR-005 behaviors? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-003, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-005]
- [x] CHK013 Do success criteria align with the publication and rendering failure requirements? [Consistency, Spec §SC-002, Spec §SC-003, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-005]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK014 Are acceptance scenarios mapped to UC-30/S-30/AT-30 artifacts consistently? [Traceability, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §User Story 3]
- [x] CHK015 Are acceptance scenarios sufficient to validate public schedule visibility and readability? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK016 Are primary public access flows fully specified in requirements and scenarios? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]
- [x] CHK017 Are alternate flows for “schedule not yet released” covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2]
- [x] CHK018 Are exception flows for publish failure and render failure covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK019 Are high-traffic performance/timeout behaviors specified as explicit requirements? [Completeness, Spec §NFR-002]
- [x] CHK020 Is the absence of auth-required flows consistent with fully public access policy? [Consistency, Spec §FR-011]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK021 Are performance requirements for public page load explicitly stated in requirements (not only success criteria)? [Completeness, Spec §NFR-001]
- [x] CHK022 Are accessibility requirements (keyboard operability, semantic HTML, focus states) specified for the public schedule page? [Completeness, Spec §NFR-003]
- [x] CHK023 Are logging/retention expectations for publication/render failures defined? [Completeness, Spec §NFR-004]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK024 Are dependencies on public CMS webpage support and endpoint availability explicitly stated? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK025 Are assumptions about public access policy consistent with requirements? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-011]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK026 Does the spec clearly define whether “session” refers to a track/session label or paper session grouping? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]
- [x] CHK027 Is “schedule announcement content” clearly distinguished from the full schedule page to avoid conflicting UI expectations? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009]
