# Balanced Requirements Checklist: Send Completed Reviews to the Editor

**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, consistency, and coverage of UC-23 requirements across functional, non-functional, and edge-case dimensions.
**Created**: 2026-02-03
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are in-app visibility requirements defined for submitted reviews? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK002 Are notification requirements defined for both email and in-app when enabled? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK003 Are admin-flagging requirements defined, including where flags are surfaced to administrators? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK004 Is the delivery trigger clearly defined as review status = submitted? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK005 Is the default notification behavior (per review, no waiting for all three) explicitly stated? [Clarity, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK006 Is “send to editor” unambiguously defined as in-app availability plus notifications when enabled? [Clarity, Spec §Assumptions]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK007 Do functional requirements align with acceptance scenarios for notification failures (editor access preserved)? [Consistency, Spec §Functional Requirements; Spec §User Scenarios]
- [x] CHK008 Do assumptions about notification channels match FR-004 and User Story 2 scenarios? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions; Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK009 Is duplicate suppression consistent between FR-006 and User Story 3 scenarios? [Consistency, Spec §Functional Requirements; Spec §User Scenarios]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK010 Are in-app visibility timing thresholds specified and measurable? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [x] CHK011 Are notification timing thresholds specified for both channels? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [x] CHK012 Is duplicate suppression measurable (single review record, at most one notification)? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK013 Are primary delivery flows defined from submission to editor visibility? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios]
- [x] CHK014 Are notification failure flows defined without blocking editor access? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios]
- [x] CHK015 Are batch submission behaviors defined for multiple reviews in a short window? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK016 Are missing editor mapping scenarios defined with safe handling? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios]
- [x] CHK017 Are authorization misconfiguration scenarios defined with logging and guidance? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios]
- [x] CHK018 Are audit/log failure scenarios defined without removing editor access? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK019 Are idempotency requirements specified for delivery and notifications? [NFR, Spec §Non-Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK020 Are observability requirements specified with status and reason details? [NFR, Spec §Non-Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK021 Are accessibility requirements for editor review visibility and notifications specified? [NFR, Spec §Non-Functional Requirements]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK022 Are assumptions about notification channels and grouping stated? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK023 Are assumptions about not waiting for all three reviews explicitly stated? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK024 Are retry/resend expectations for notification failures documented? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK025 Are notification grouping rules defined with a concrete batching window? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK026 Are there any conflicts between optional notifications and required in-app visibility? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions; Spec §Functional Requirements]
