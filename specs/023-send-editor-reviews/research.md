# Research: Send Completed Reviews to the Editor

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Feature**: /home/ivissers/ece_493/labs/lab2/lab2/specs/023-send-editor-reviews/spec.md

## Decisions

- **Decision**: No additional technology or dependency changes required.
  **Rationale**: Delivery and notifications can be implemented within existing
  MVC structure using localStorage/in-memory data and existing notification
  stubs.
  **Alternatives considered**: External notification libraries (rejected; violates
  no-framework constraint).
