# Requirements Quality Checklist: Save Submission Draft

**Purpose**: Validate requirements clarity, completeness, consistency, and coverage for UC-12 draft save behavior
**Created**: 2026-02-02
**Feature**: `/home/ivissers/ece_493/labs/lab2/lab2/specs/012-save-submission-draft/spec.md`

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are draft save and reopen flows fully specified (save, confirm, reopen, restore)? [Completeness, Spec §Acceptance Scenarios, Spec §FR-001–FR-003]
- [x] CHK002 Are overwrite rules for multiple saves explicit and consistent? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002, Spec §SC-001]
- [x] CHK003 Is file attachment persistence defined for drafts? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK004 Are "confirmation" and "alternate indicator" defined with minimum UI evidence? [Gap, Spec §FR-005]
- [x] CHK005 Is "prevent editing" on retrieval failure clearly defined (blocked state)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK006 Do assumptions about draft permissiveness match scenarios and FR-004? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §Acceptance Scenarios, Spec §FR-004]
- [x] CHK007 Are non-expiring drafts consistent between assumptions and out-of-scope items? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §Out of Scope]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK008 Are success criteria measurable and mapped to each key draft outcome? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001–SC-005]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK009 Are all UC-12 extensions covered (incomplete fields, save failure, session expired, confirmation failure, retrieval failure)? [Coverage, Spec §Acceptance Scenarios]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK010 Are edge cases mapped to requirements or explicitly excluded? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK011 Is the 200 ms confirmation target scoped to UI-visible feedback? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-001]
- [x] CHK012 Are accessibility requirements defined for save and load feedback states? [Gap, Spec §NFR-002]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK013 Are dependencies for storage and file attachment persistence documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK014 Is "latest draft" behavior defined when multiple rapid saves occur? [Ambiguity, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-002]
