# Requirements Quality Checklist: Validate Registration Email

**Purpose**: Validate requirements clarity, completeness, consistency, and testability
**Created**: 2026-01-31
**Feature**: /home/ivissers/ece_493/labs/lab2/lab2/specs/002-validate-registration-email/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are all required validation steps specified (format, uniqueness, fail-safe handling)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001..FR-007]
- [x] CHK002 Are whitespace handling requirements specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [x] CHK003 Are out-of-scope behaviors explicitly stated (e.g., what registration steps are excluded)? [Gap]
- [x] CHK004 Are failure logging requirements explicitly stated? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK005 Is email format defined with explicit criteria and allowed characters? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003]
- [x] CHK006 Is “clear invalid-format error message” defined with objective content or structure? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-005]
- [x] CHK007 Is “validation error message” for data-store failure defined with objective content? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-007]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK008 Do edge cases align with requirements (whitespace trim, case-insensitive uniqueness)? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases + §FR-002/FR-004]
- [x] CHK009 Do success criteria align with functional requirements? [Consistency, Spec §SC-001..SC-004 + §FR-001..FR-009]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK010 Are success criteria measurable for valid/invalid/duplicate/failure outcomes? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001..SC-004]
- [x] CHK011 Is the logging requirement in SC-004 measurable (what constitutes a “log entry”)? [Ambiguity, Spec §SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK012 Are primary, invalid-format, duplicate, and data-store failure scenarios covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]
- [x] CHK013 Is short-circuit behavior for invalid format captured? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK014 Are whitespace and case-variant email behaviors defined? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK015 Are illegal-character examples or rejection behavior explicitly specified beyond the allowed set? [Gap, Spec §FR-003]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK016 Are performance requirements specified for validation latency? [Gap]
- [x] CHK017 Are accessibility requirements specified for validation error presentation? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK018 Are data-store availability assumptions documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK019 Are retry expectations documented if the store is temporarily unavailable? [Gap]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK020 Is “registration can continue” defined with an explicit next-step outcome? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-009]

## Notes

- Unchecked items indicate missing or ambiguous requirements in the spec.
