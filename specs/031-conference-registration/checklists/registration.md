# Requirements Quality Checklist: Conference Registration

**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, consistency, and coverage of registration requirements before implementation
**Created**: 2026-02-03
**Feature**: /home/ivissers/ece_493/labs/lab2/lab2/specs/031-conference-registration/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are registration window rules explicitly defined? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-007]
- [x] CHK002 Are required registration fields explicitly listed? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [x] CHK003 Are duplicate registration prevention rules explicitly stated? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006]
- [x] CHK004 Are confirmation messaging requirements explicitly stated? [Completeness, Spec §FR-009]
- [x] CHK005 Are notification delivery requirements explicitly stated? [Completeness, Spec §FR-010]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK006 Is “registration window” defined with start/end behavior and visible dates? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK007 Is “attendance type” defined or constrained? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003]
- [x] CHK008 Is “confirmation receipt/summary” clearly defined in content and delivery? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK009 Do user stories align with the requirement that any authenticated user can register? [Consistency, Spec §FR-013, Spec §User Story 1]
- [x] CHK010 Do edge cases align with payment rules (required unless price=0)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-012, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK011 Do success criteria align with duplicate prevention and logging requirements? [Consistency, Spec §SC-002, Spec §SC-003, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-011]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK012 Are acceptance scenarios mapped to UC-31/S-31/AT-31 artifacts consistently? [Traceability, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §User Story 3]
- [x] CHK013 Are acceptance scenarios sufficient to validate registration success, closed window, and failures? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1-3]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK014 Are primary registration flows fully specified? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]
- [x] CHK015 Are closed-window flows fully specified? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2]
- [x] CHK016 Are validation errors, duplicate registration, and save failures covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3]
- [x] CHK017 Are notification failure flows explicitly covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK018 Are payment failure behaviors specified beyond edge-case notes? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK019 Are retry behaviors for payment failure explicitly defined? [Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK020 Are performance expectations for registration completion explicitly stated as NFRs (not only success criteria)? [Gap]
- [x] CHK021 Are accessibility requirements specified for the registration form? [Gap]
- [x] CHK022 Are log retention requirements specified for save/notification failures? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK023 Are dependencies on payment service availability explicitly stated? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK024 Are assumptions about open eligibility consistent with requirements? [Assumption, Spec §FR-013]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK025 Is “authorized user” terminology consistent with “any authenticated user”? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-013, Spec §User Stories]
- [x] CHK026 Is “registration window” behavior consistent between requirements and assumptions? [Consistency, Spec §FR-001, Spec §Assumptions]
