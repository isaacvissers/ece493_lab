# Requirements Quality Checklist: Validate Paper Submission Fields

**Purpose**: Validate requirements clarity, completeness, consistency, and coverage for UC-11 validation behavior
**Created**: 2026-02-02
**Feature**: `/home/ivissers/ece_493/labs/lab2/lab2/specs/011-validate-submission-fields/spec.md`

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are all required fields explicitly listed in one place and consistent across scenarios and requirements? [Completeness, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-001]
- [x] CHK002 Are draft-save rules defined for both missing required fields and format validation? [Completeness, Spec §FR-008, Spec §FR-010]
- [x] CHK003 Is the accepted file extension list explicit and consistent across scenarios and requirements? [Completeness, Spec §Acceptance Scenarios, Spec §FR-004]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK004 Are "clear error messages" defined with minimum content requirements (field name + corrective guidance)? [Gap, Spec §FR-006]
- [x] CHK005 Is the term "validation feedback" scoped to UI-visible timing from submit action? [Clarity, Spec §NFR-001]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK006 Do draft-save assumptions match the acceptance scenarios and FR-010? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §Acceptance Scenarios, Spec §FR-010]
- [x] CHK007 Are required-field lists consistent with UC-11 traceability artifacts? [Consistency, Spec §Traceability, Spec §Assumptions]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK008 Are success criteria measurable and mapped to each validation outcome? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001–SC-006]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK009 Are all UC-11 alternative paths represented in acceptance scenarios (missing fields, invalid email, missing file, invalid type, multiple errors, draft save)? [Coverage, Spec §Acceptance Scenarios]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK010 Are edge cases mapped to requirements or explicitly excluded? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK011 Are accessibility requirements defined for all error states and validation feedback presentation? [Gap, Spec §NFR-002]
- [x] CHK012 Is performance target defined in a testable scope (end-to-end vs UI-only)? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-001]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK013 Are dependencies for validation (submission form state and file selection) explicitly documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK014 Is "submission proceeds" defined (e.g., confirmation step) without implying implementation detail? [Ambiguity, Spec §Acceptance Scenarios, Spec §FR-009]
