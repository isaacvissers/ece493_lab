## Decisions

### Decision 1: Notification channels
- **Decision**: Use both email and in-app notifications after schedule publication.
- **Rationale**: Maximizes reach while keeping an in-app fallback.
- **Alternatives considered**: Email only; in-app only.

### Decision 2: Notification recipients
- **Decision**: Notify all co-authors.
- **Rationale**: Ensures every author gets the final schedule details.
- **Alternatives considered**: Submitting author only; corresponding author only.

### Decision 3: Additional details
- **Decision**: Deliver time and room only (no session chair or presentation format).
- **Rationale**: Keeps delivery consistent with core schedule information required by UC-29.
- **Alternatives considered**: Include session chair; include presentation format; include both.
