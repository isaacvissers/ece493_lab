# Requirements Quality Checklist: Validate Registration Password

**Purpose**: Validate requirements clarity, completeness, consistency, and testability
**Created**: 2026-01-31
**Feature**: /home/ivissers/ece_493/labs/lab2/lab2/specs/003-validate-registration-password/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are all required validation steps specified (policy retrieval, checks, failure handling)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001..FR-010]
- [x] CHK002 Are out-of-scope behaviors explicitly stated (e.g., password updates)? [Gap, Spec §Out of Scope]
- [x] CHK003 Are password policy sources and retrieval mechanisms specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001a]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK004 Is the password policy defined with explicit minimum length and complexity rules? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003..FR-004]
- [x] CHK005 Is “clear error message” defined with objective content or structure? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006a..FR-006c]
- [x] CHK006 Is “validation-unavailable” error content defined with objective wording? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007a]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK007 Do success criteria align with functional requirements? [Consistency, Spec §SC-001..SC-005 + §FR-001..FR-010]
- [x] CHK008 Do edge cases align with requirements (whitespace/forbidden content)? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases + §FR-005a]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK009 Are success criteria measurable for compliant and failure outcomes? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001..SC-005]
- [x] CHK010 Is the logging requirement in SC-005 measurable (what constitutes a “log entry”)? [Clarity, Spec §SC-005]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK011 Are primary, too-short, complexity, disallowed-content, and policy-retrieval failure scenarios covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]
- [x] CHK012 Is recovery after invalid password covered? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK013 Are whitespace handling rules explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005a]
- [x] CHK014 Are disallowed-content examples or forbidden patterns specified beyond general mention? [Completeness, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK015 Are performance requirements specified for validation latency? [Completeness, Spec §NFR-001]
- [x] CHK016 Are accessibility requirements specified for validation error presentation? [Completeness, Spec §NFR-002]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK017 Are policy availability assumptions documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK018 Are retry expectations documented if policy retrieval fails? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007b]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK019 Is “workflow continues” defined with an explicit next-step outcome? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009]

## Notes

- All checks passed after spec updates.
