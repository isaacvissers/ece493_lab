# Data Model: Validate Registration Password

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Feature**: /home/ivissers/ece_493/labs/lab2/lab2/specs/003-validate-registration-password/spec.md

## Summary

No separate data model is required for this feature. Password validation uses a
static, hardcoded policy within the application and does not introduce or modify
persistent entities.
