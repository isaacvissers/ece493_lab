# Requirements Quality Checklist: Enter Manuscript Metadata

**Purpose**: Validate requirements clarity, completeness, consistency, and coverage for metadata entry
**Created**: 2026-02-02
**Feature**: `/home/ivissers/ece_493/labs/lab2/lab2/specs/010-enter-manuscript-metadata/spec.md`

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are required fields listed consistently between scenarios and requirements? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios, Spec §FR-001]
- [x] CHK002 Are save/submit outcomes fully specified (persistence + confirmation)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-006]
- [x] CHK003 Is the "editable only before finalization" rule stated as a requirement (not just an assumption)? [Gap, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK004 Are draft-save validation rules defined (what is allowed vs blocked)? [Gap, Spec §FR-007]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK005 Is "main source" defined with allowable values or constraints? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-001]
- [x] CHK006 Is contact info explicitly limited to email with a defined format? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003]
- [x] CHK007 Are error messages specified with actionable content per field? [Gap, Spec §FR-009, Spec §FR-010, Spec §FR-011]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK008 Do Out of Scope statements avoid contradicting keyword limits in requirements? [Conflict, Spec §Out of Scope, Spec §FR-004]
- [x] CHK009 Are keyword rules consistent between Assumptions and FR-004? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-004]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK010 Is draft persistence measurable and verifiable? [Measurability, Spec §SC-006]
- [x] CHK011 Are validation performance and accessibility criteria objectively testable? [Measurability, Spec §NFR-001, Spec §NFR-002]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK012 Do acceptance scenarios cover invalid data handling for draft saves? [Gap, Spec §Acceptance Scenarios]
- [x] CHK013 Is the database-failure scenario aligned with FR-012 and SC-005? [Consistency, Spec §Acceptance Scenarios, Spec §FR-012, Spec §SC-005]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK014 Are listed edge cases mapped to requirements or explicitly excluded? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK015 Is the "extremely long abstract" edge case bounded or explicitly excluded? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §Out of Scope]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK016 Are accessibility requirements defined for all inputs and error states (not just errors)? [Gap, Spec §NFR-002]
- [x] CHK017 Is the validation response-time target scoped (client vs server or end-to-end)? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-001]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK018 Are dependencies for draft and final persistence documented? [Gap, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK019 Is "metadata draft" lifecycle defined (create/overwrite/delete)? [Gap, Spec §Key Entities]
- [x] CHK020 Are logging requirements consistent with "transient; no persistence" language? [Clarity, Spec §FR-012, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §Key Entities]
