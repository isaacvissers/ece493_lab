**Created**: 2026-02-03
**Feature**: /home/ivissers/ece_493/labs/lab2/lab2/specs/027-view-schedule/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are authorization requirements defined for all HTML schedule view access? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [x] CHK002 Are behaviors defined for no schedule, partial schedule, and rendering failures? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-006]
- [x] CHK003 Are loading/timeout behaviors specified for slow render scenarios? [Completeness, Spec §FR-008]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK004 Is “published schedule only” defined without ambiguity about draft visibility? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]
- [x] CHK005 Is the agenda list layout described with explicit grouping/ordering? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003, Spec §Clarifications]
- [x] CHK006 Is the “Unscheduled” section placement clearly defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005, Spec §Clarifications]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK007 Do assumptions about internal-only HTML view align with success criteria and user stories? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §US1]
- [x] CHK008 Do error-handling requirements align with acceptance scenarios for rendering failures and timeouts? [Consistency, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-008, Spec §US3]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK009 Are success criteria measurable for render speed and error handling? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-003, Spec §SC-004]
- [x] CHK010 Is “valid time and room assignments” objectively verifiable? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK011 Are primary view scenarios fully specified for schedule rendering? [Coverage, Spec §US1]
- [x] CHK012 Are empty/partial schedule scenarios fully specified? [Coverage, Spec §US2]
- [x] CHK013 Are unauthorized and render-failure scenarios fully specified? [Coverage, Spec §US3]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK014 Are missing schedule and partial draft edge cases explicitly defined? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-005]
- [x] CHK015 Are slow render and timeout edge cases explicitly defined? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-008]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK016 Are performance requirements beyond SC-003 defined (e.g., interaction latency)? [Non-Functional, Gap]
- [x] CHK017 Are accessibility requirements specified for HTML schedule view? [Non-Functional, Gap]
- [x] CHK018 Are logging/audit requirements specified for unauthorized access and render failures? [Non-Functional, Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK019 Are assumptions about published-only visibility documented and validated? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK020 Are user role/permission boundaries explicitly bounded (admin vs editor scope)? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK021 Is the public-facing styling scope explicitly excluded? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
