**Purpose**: Validate requirements clarity, completeness, consistency, and testability
**Created**: 2026-01-31
**Feature**: /home/ivissers/ece_493/labs/lab2/lab2/specs/001-register-account/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are all required registration fields explicitly enumerated and limited to email + password only? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002]
- [x] CHK002 Are email format requirements specified beyond the phrase “valid format”? [Gap, Spec §FR-003]
- [x] CHK003 Are password policy requirements fully specified (length, number, symbol) with no missing constraints? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [x] CHK004 Are post-registration outcomes fully specified, including auto-login and redirect destination? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006]
- [x] CHK005 Are success confirmation requirements defined (content or form of confirmation)? [Gap, Spec §FR-006]
- [x] CHK006 Are error message requirements defined for each failure case (invalid email, invalid password, duplicate email, DB failure)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007 + §User Scenarios]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK007 Is “user-friendly error messages” defined with objective criteria? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-007]
- [x] CHK008 Is “valid email format” definition specified with clear acceptance criteria? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-003]
- [x] CHK009 Is the “dashboard” destination defined so redirect target is unambiguous? [Gap, Spec §FR-006]
- [x] CHK010 Is “account created and stored” defined with an explicit success state (what data must persist)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK011 Do the Independent Test and FR-006 agree on redirect destination (login vs dashboard)? [Conflict, Spec §User Story 1 + §FR-006]
- [x] CHK012 Are SC-003 and FR-006 aligned on auto-login + redirect behavior? [Consistency, Spec §SC-003 + §FR-006]
- [x] CHK013 Are assumptions about required fields consistent with FR-002 (email + password only)? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions + §FR-002]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK014 Is SC-001 measurable with a defined test context for “under 2 minutes”? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001]
- [x] CHK015 Is SC-002 measurable given the phrase “clear, actionable error messages”? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002]
- [x] CHK016 Are SC-003 and SC-004 measurable with unambiguous evidence of success? [Measurability, Spec §SC-003 + §SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK017 Are recovery requirements specified after each validation error beyond the edge-case bullets? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK018 Are requirements defined for repeated registration attempts after a DB failure? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases + §User Scenarios]
- [x] CHK019 Are alternate paths (invalid email/password/duplicate email) mapped to explicit requirement statements? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios + §FR-007]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK020 Are requirements defined for blank-field submissions (which fields, expected outcome)? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK021 Are requirements defined for case-variant email inputs (e.g., User@X vs user@x)? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-004]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK022 Are accessibility requirements specified for the registration flow (keyboard, focus, error announcement)? [Gap, Spec §Requirements]
- [x] CHK023 Are performance requirements specified for registration interactions? [Gap, Spec §Requirements]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK024 Are data-store availability assumptions translated into explicit requirements for failure handling? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions + §FR-007]
- [x] CHK025 Is the “no email verification” choice reflected consistently across requirements and scenarios? [Consistency, Spec §FR-005a + §User Scenarios]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK026 Is the term “dashboard” defined in the spec’s terminology to prevent misinterpretation? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-006]

## Notes

- Incomplete items indicate missing or ambiguous requirements in the spec.

## Refresh Additions (Formal Release Gate)

- [x] CHK027 Is the email uniqueness rule explicitly tied to case-insensitive comparison in all relevant sections? [Consistency, Spec §FR-004 + §SC-004]
- [x] CHK028 Are retry-after-failure requirements specific about what state must be preserved between attempts? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009]
- [x] CHK029 Are success confirmation requirements aligned with terminology for “dashboard” and “signed in”? [Consistency, Spec §FR-006 + §Terminology]
- [x] CHK030 Are error recovery instructions constrained to a single actionable step in all cases? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]
- [x] CHK031 Are accessibility requirements measurable (keyboard operable, visible focus, screen reader association)? [Measurability, Spec §NFR-002 + §NFR-003]
- [x] CHK032 Are performance requirements scoped to registration interactions only (submit, validation, redirect)? [Clarity, Spec §NFR-001]
