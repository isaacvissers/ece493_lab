# Requirements Quality Checklist: Store Payment Confirmation

**Purpose**: Release-gate checklist for requirements quality across the full payment confirmation flow (ingestion, storage, status update, reconciliation, audit logging).
**Created**: 2026-02-05
**Feature**: /home/ivissers/ece_493/labs/lab2/lab2/specs/035-store-payment-confirmation/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are ingestion channel requirements (redirect + webhook) explicitly documented? [Completeness, Spec §FR-014]
- [ ] CHK002 Are validation requirements for authenticity, amount, currency, and order match fully specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK003 Are idempotency requirements defined with a specific key and behavior? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK004 Are storage requirements for confirmation fields fully enumerated? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK005 Are status update requirements defined after successful storage? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK006 Are audit logging requirements defined for confirmation and status update? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK007 Are unmatched confirmation handling requirements specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK008 Are downstream trigger requirements defined, including non-blocking failure behavior? [Completeness, Spec §FR-013]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK009 Is “Paid/Confirmed” status transition defined unambiguously? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK010 Is the HMAC signature verification requirement precise enough to implement (e.g., header + verification scope)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK011 Is the idempotency rule explicit about what constitutes a duplicate and expected response? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK012 Is the “unmatched queue/store” behavior described in a testable way? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK013 Is the “retry or queue” requirement for status update failures specific enough to verify? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK014 Do duplicate-handling requirements match idempotency expectations across scenarios and FRs? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §FR-002, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK015 Are validation failure behaviors consistent between scenarios and requirements? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK016 Do assumptions about retention align with any data storage requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-003, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-007]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK017 Are success criteria measurable and tied to confirmation storage and status update outcomes? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK018 Do success criteria fully cover invalid confirmations and duplicates? [Completeness, Spec §SC-002, Spec §SC-003]
- [ ] CHK019 Is the failure-handling success criterion specific enough to be objectively verified? [Clarity, Spec §SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK020 Are primary flows fully captured for valid confirmation ingestion and status update? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK021 Are alternate flows defined for invalid and duplicate confirmations? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK022 Are recovery flows defined for storage, status update, and audit log failures? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK023 Are all listed edge cases mapped to explicit requirements or acceptance scenarios? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK024 Is the “no matching order” edge case fully specified with queueing and logging requirements? [Completeness, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK025 Is downstream trigger failure behavior defined without rollback ambiguity? [Clarity, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-013]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK026 Are performance expectations for confirmation handling explicitly stated beyond the 1-minute success criterion? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK027 Are security requirements beyond HMAC (e.g., replay protection or timestamp tolerance) explicitly documented? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK028 Is accessibility explicitly scoped out or defined for any UI surfaced by this feature? [Completeness, Spec §Assumptions]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK029 Are assumptions about required confirmation fields complete and aligned with data model expectations? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK030 Are retention assumptions explicit for confirmations, audit logs, and unmatched queues? [Completeness, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK031 Are delivery channel assumptions (redirect + webhook) consistent with requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §FR-014]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK032 Are any terms like “valid confirmation” or “fallback logging” defined with concrete criteria? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK033 Are there any conflicts between failure-handling requirements and success criteria? [Conflict, Spec §FR-009, Spec §FR-010, Spec §SC-004]
