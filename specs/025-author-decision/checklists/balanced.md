**Purpose**: Validate clarity, completeness, and consistency of UC-25 requirements before implementation
**Created**: 2026-02-03
**Feature**: /home/ivissers/ece_493/labs/lab2/lab2/specs/025-author-decision/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are in-app visibility requirements defined for released decisions and pending staged decisions? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-008, Spec §FR-009]
- [x] CHK002 Are notification requirements defined for enabled channels and failure handling? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-007]
- [x] CHK003 Are role-based access requirements defined for authors and non-authors? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-010]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK004 Is “configured release time” defined with a measurable rule (timezone/source of truth) rather than a vague reference? [Clarity, Spec §FR-008, Ambiguity]
- [x] CHK005 Are “pending” state visibility rules explicitly described (what is shown vs hidden)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009]
- [x] CHK006 Is the scope of “all co-authors” clearly defined (ordering/ownership changes)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011, Spec §FR-010]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK007 Do the staged-release requirements align with “decision visible in-app” without conflict? [Consistency, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-008, Spec §FR-009]
- [x] CHK008 Do notification requirements align with “notifications are optional” in assumptions? [Consistency, Spec §FR-005, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK009 Are access-control rules consistent between user stories and functional requirements? [Consistency, Spec §US3, Spec §FR-003, Spec §FR-004]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK010 Are success criteria measurable and time-bound for in-app visibility? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-001]
- [x] CHK011 Are success criteria measurable for notification delivery timeliness? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-003]
- [x] CHK012 Is “pending before release” objectively verifiable in success criteria? [Measurability, Spec §SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK013 Are primary in-app view flows fully specified for authors? [Coverage, Spec §US1]
- [x] CHK014 Are notification enablement/disablement scenarios specified (including disabled state)? [Coverage, Gap]
- [x] CHK015 Are unauthorized access scenarios specified with expected system response? [Coverage, Spec §US3, Spec §FR-004]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK016 Are failure scenarios for notification delivery explicitly defined in requirements? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-006]
- [x] CHK017 Are invalid or missing author email cases explicitly defined? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-007]
- [x] CHK018 Are “notes absent” scenarios explicitly defined for display behavior? [Edge Case, Spec §US3]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK019 Are performance requirements specified for decision view latency beyond success criteria? [Non-Functional, Gap]
- [x] CHK020 Are accessibility requirements specified for decision visibility and notifications? [Non-Functional, Gap]
- [x] CHK021 Are audit/logging retention requirements specified for access-denied and notification failures? [Non-Functional, Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK022 Are assumptions about notification channels and fallbacks explicitly validated? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK023 Are dependencies on conference-level configuration for staged release documented? [Dependency, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK024 Is the storage/visibility of decision notes aligned with “optional notes” assumption? [Consistency, Spec §FR-002, Spec §Assumptions]
