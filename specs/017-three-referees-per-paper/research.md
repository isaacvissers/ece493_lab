# Research: Ensure Exactly Three Referees per Paper

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Feature**: /home/ivissers/ece_493/labs/lab2/lab2/specs/017-three-referees-per-paper/spec.md

## Decisions

- **Decision**: No additional technology or dependency changes required.
  **Rationale**: The feature can be implemented with existing MVC structure and
  localStorage/in-memory storage.
  **Alternatives considered**: External workflow engines (rejected; violates
  no-framework constraint).
