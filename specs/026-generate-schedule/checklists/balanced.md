# Requirements Quality Checklist: Generate Conference Schedule

**Purpose**: Validate clarity, completeness, and consistency of UC-26 requirements before implementation
**Created**: 2026-02-03
**Feature**: /home/ivissers/ece_493/labs/lab2/lab2/specs/026-generate-schedule/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are scheduling inputs (dates/times, rooms, slot duration, constraints) fully specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002]
- [x] CHK002 Are draft schedule creation and review requirements fully defined? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006]
- [x] CHK003 Are save and publish behaviors defined for success and failure? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007, Spec §FR-012, Spec §FR-013]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK004 Is “capacity sufficient” quantified (papers vs slots) rather than implied? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-009, Ambiguity]
- [x] CHK005 Is the definition of “scheduling conflict” explicit (room/time overlap rule)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]
- [x] CHK006 Are criteria for “required metadata” explicitly listed? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011, Ambiguity]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK007 Do conflict-handling rules align between requirements and clarifications? [Consistency, Spec §FR-005, Spec §Clarifications]
- [x] CHK008 Do empty-draft rules align between requirements and assumptions? [Consistency, Spec §FR-008, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK009 Do partial-draft rules align between requirements and user stories? [Consistency, Spec §FR-009, Spec §US2]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK010 Are success criteria measurable for scheduling completeness? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-001]
- [x] CHK011 Is performance target for schedule generation measurable and testable? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002]
- [x] CHK012 Are access-control success criteria objective and verifiable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK013 Are primary admin schedule generation flows fully specified? [Coverage, Spec §US1]
- [x] CHK014 Are invalid input scenarios specified with expected system responses? [Coverage, Spec §US2, Spec §FR-010]
- [x] CHK015 Are save and publish failure scenarios specified? [Coverage, Spec §US3]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK016 Are “no accepted papers” behaviors explicitly specified? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-008]
- [x] CHK017 Are capacity shortfall behaviors explicitly specified with unscheduled paper handling? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-009]
- [x] CHK018 Are missing-metadata papers explicitly excluded and flagged? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-011]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK019 Are performance expectations beyond SC-002 defined (e.g., interaction latency)? [Non-Functional, Gap]
- [x] CHK020 Are accessibility requirements specified for scheduling inputs and schedule views? [Non-Functional, Gap]
- [x] CHK021 Are logging/audit requirements specified for access and save/publish failures? [Non-Functional, Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK022 Are dependencies on accepted-paper status and conference configuration documented? [Dependency, Spec §FR-003, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK023 Are constraints/algorithm tradeoffs documented (auto-draft vs manual editing)? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK024 Is publication scope (authors/attendees) explicitly bounded? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
