# Research: Make Final Accept/Reject Decision

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Feature**: /home/ivissers/ece_493/labs/lab2/lab2/specs/024-final-decision/spec.md

## Decisions

- **Decision**: No additional technology or dependency changes required.
  **Rationale**: Decision validation and persistence can be implemented within the
  existing MVC structure using localStorage/in-memory storage.
  **Alternatives considered**: External workflow/notification libraries (rejected;
  violates no-framework constraint).
