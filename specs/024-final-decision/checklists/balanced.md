# Balanced Requirements Checklist: Make Final Accept/Reject Decision

**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, consistency, and coverage of UC-24 requirements across functional, non-functional, and edge-case dimensions.
**Created**: 2026-02-03
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are eligibility rules for exactly three completed reviews specified? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK002 Are decision input requirements (Accept/Reject selection) specified? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK003 Are decision finality/reset rules specified? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK004 Is “exactly three reviews” unambiguous and aligned with prior assignment rules? [Clarity, Spec §Clarifications; Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK005 Is the decision queue eligibility filter clearly defined? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK006 Is decision save atomicity clearly defined (no partial updates)? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK007 Do acceptance scenarios align with FR-004/FR-005 gating rules? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios; Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK008 Do assumptions about decision finality align with FR-012? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions; Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK009 Do notification requirements align with failure-handling scenarios? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios; Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK010 Are success criteria measurable for decision save and status update timing? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [x] CHK011 Are blocking outcomes measurable for invalid review counts? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [x] CHK012 Is validation for missing decision selection measurable? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK013 Are primary accept and reject decision flows fully specified? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios]
- [x] CHK014 Are fewer-than-three review scenarios specified with messaging? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios]
- [x] CHK015 Are more-than-three review scenarios specified with handling policy? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK016 Are authorization failures specified with logging and denial? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios]
- [x] CHK017 Are DB save failures specified with safe rollback? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios]
- [x] CHK018 Are notification failures specified without rollback? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK019 Are performance expectations specified for decision submission UX? [NFR, Spec §Non-Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK020 Are accessibility requirements specified for decision entry UI? [NFR, Spec §Non-Functional Requirements]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK021 Are assumptions about optional comments documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK022 Are assumptions about notification configuration documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK023 Is the “exactly three reviews” policy consistent across spec sections? [Consistency, Spec §Clarifications; Spec §Functional Requirements; Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK024 Are there any conflicts between decision finality and admin reset behavior? [Consistency, Spec §Functional Requirements; Spec §Assumptions]
