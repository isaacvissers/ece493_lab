**Purpose**: Validate requirements quality for over-assignment detection and alerting
**Created**: 2026-02-03
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are over-assignment detection rules defined for count > 3? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK002 Are blocking rules defined for assignment attempts that exceed three? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK003 Are guidance actions defined for correcting over-assignments? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK004 Are view-time alerts defined for already over-assigned papers? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK005 Are batch overage behaviors defined (partial apply + blocked list)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 Is the reviewer count rule explicitly stated as maximum three? [Clarity, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK007 Is “alert” content defined (current count + guidance)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001, §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the “blocked additions identified” outcome explicit? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK009 Do user stories and FRs consistently require blocking over-assignment? [Consistency, Spec §US1, §FR-002, §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK010 Do batch scenarios align with partial-apply rule? [Consistency, Spec §US2, §FR-004]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK011 Do acceptance scenarios cover add-time blocking and alerting? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §US1]
- [ ] CHK012 Do acceptance scenarios cover view-time alerting? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §US1]
- [ ] CHK013 Do acceptance scenarios cover batch overage identification? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §US2]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK014 Are primary detection and alert flows covered? [Scenario Coverage, Spec §US1]
- [ ] CHK015 Are alternate batch flows covered? [Scenario Coverage, Spec §US2]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK016 Is already-over-assigned-on-view handled? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK017 Is UI alert failure handled with fallback? [Edge Case, Spec §US3]
- [ ] CHK018 Is count lookup failure handled with fail-safe? [Edge Case, Spec §US3]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK019 Are performance targets defined for count checks? [Completeness, Spec §NFR-001]
- [ ] CHK020 Are accessibility requirements defined for alert messages? [Completeness, Spec §NFR-002]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK021 Are assumptions about max-three policy and blocking explicit? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK022 Is the guidance path explicit when unassign is not supported? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-003, §Edge Cases]
