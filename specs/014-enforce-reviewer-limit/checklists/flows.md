## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for assigning a reviewer when under the limit? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements defined for blocking assignments at the limit? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK003 Are bulk assignment requirements defined for mixed eligibility? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK004 Are fail-safe requirements defined for lookup failures? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK005 Are fail-safe requirements defined for persistence failures? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK006 Are concurrency handling requirements specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK007 Is "active assignment" clearly defined in requirements or assumptions? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the cap value (5) explicitly stated without ambiguity? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK009 Is the partial-apply rule for bulk assignment unambiguous? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK010 Are error outcomes described with clear, user-facing messages? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK011 Is "fail-safe" behavior specified in concrete terms? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK012 Do the user stories and functional requirements describe the same limit behavior? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK013 Do edge cases align with the acceptance scenarios for lookup/save failures? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK014 Are clarifications consistent with the assumptions section? [Consistency, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK015 Do success criteria align with the defined functional requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Success Criteria, Spec §FR-001]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK016 Are success criteria measurable without implementation details? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK017 Is the success criterion for concurrency (never exceed 5) objectively testable? [Measurability, Spec §SC-003]
- [ ] CHK018 Is the bulk-assignment outcome criterion measurable? [Measurability, Spec §SC-005]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK019 Are primary (happy-path) requirements complete and clear? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK020 Are alternate-path requirements for bulk assignment complete? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK021 Are exception-path requirements defined for lookup failures? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3]
- [ ] CHK022 Are exception-path requirements defined for save failures? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3]
- [ ] CHK023 Are concurrency scenarios explicitly addressed in requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK024 Are boundary conditions (exactly 5 assignments) explicitly covered? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK025 Are mixed-eligibility bulk assignments explicitly covered? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK026 Are lookup failures treated as blocking (fail-safe) rather than permissive? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-004]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK027 Are performance expectations for assignment interactions explicitly stated? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK028 Are accessibility requirements for assignment workflows explicitly stated? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK029 Are assumptions about "no conference association" captured and used consistently? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK030 Are assumptions about override policy reflected in requirements? [Assumption, Spec §Clarifications]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK031 Is "global" scope defined without conflicting references to conferences or tracks? [Ambiguity, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK032 Are any requirements dependent on unspecified data sources or services? [Gap]
