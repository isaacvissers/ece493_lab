# Use Case UC-16: Receive review invitation by email

**Goal in Context**: A reviewer receives a review invitation by email so they can accept or reject a paper review assignment.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Reviewer (Referee)  
**Secondary Actors**: Editor; Email/Notification Service; CMS Database  
**Trigger**: An editor assigns the reviewer to a paper (or sends an invitation) and the system generates an invitation email to the reviewer.

## Success End Condition
* The reviewer receives an email invitation containing sufficient details and a way to respond (accept or reject), and CMS records that the invitation was delivered/sent successfully.

## Failed End Condition
* The reviewer does not receive the invitation, receives an incomplete/incorrect invitation, or cannot respond (accept/reject), preventing the review process from proceeding reliably.

## Preconditions
* A paper exists and is eligible for review assignment.
* An editor (or the system) initiates a review invitation for the reviewer.
* The reviewer has a reachable email address on file (or provided by editor during assignment).
* The email/notification service is available.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The editor assigns a reviewer to a submitted paper and confirms the assignment.
2. The system creates a review invitation for the reviewer and associates it with the paper in the database.
3. The system generates an invitation email containing:
   * paper identification (e.g., title/ID),
   * the reviewer role/assignment context,
   * instructions to accept or reject,
   * links (or tokens) to **Accept** and **Reject** the assignment.
4. The system sends the invitation email to the reviewer’s email address via the notification service.
5. The reviewer receives the email in their inbox.
6. The reviewer selects the **Accept** or **Reject** option from the email.
7. The system records the reviewer’s response and updates the assignment status accordingly.
8. The system displays confirmation to the reviewer that their response was recorded (e.g., via landing page after clicking accept/reject).

## Extensions
* **4a**: Email/notification service fails to send the invitation  
    * **4a1**: The system displays a warning to the editor (or logs a send failure status).
    * **4a2**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
    * **4a3**: The invitation remains pending and can be retried.
* **5a**: Invitation email is delivered but goes to spam or is not seen  
    * **5a1**: The reviewer does not respond within a defined period.
    * **5a2**: The system may allow the editor to resend the invitation (if supported).
* **6a**: Reviewer clicks accept/reject link but the link is invalid or expired  
    * **6a1**: The system displays an error indicating the invitation link is invalid/expired.
    * **6a2**: The system does not record a response.
    * **6a3**: The reviewer is instructed to request a new invitation.
* **6b**: Reviewer attempts to respond twice (duplicate response)  
    * **6b1**: The system detects the invitation already has a recorded response.
    * **6b2**: The system displays a message indicating the response is already recorded and prevents changing it (unless re-opened by editor).
* **2a**: Reviewer email address is missing or malformed  
    * **2a1**: The system prevents sending and notifies the editor that a valid reviewer email is required.
    * **2a2**: The invitation is not sent until corrected.
* **7a**: Database write fails when recording response  
    * **7a1**: The system displays an error indicating the response could not be recorded at this time.
    * **7a2**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
    * **7a3**: The assignment status remains unchanged and the reviewer may retry.
