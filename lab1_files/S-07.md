# UC-07 Scenario Narratives — Change Password

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-07: Change password**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

A registered user is logged in to the Conference Management System (CMS) and decides to change their password to maintain account security. The user navigates to their account or security settings area and selects the **Change Password** option.

The CMS displays a password change form and prompts the user to enter their current password along with a new password (and a confirmation of the new password if required). The user enters their current password and chooses a new password that meets the system’s password security standards. The user submits the request.

The CMS verifies that the current password provided matches the password stored in the CMS database for that user. Once verified, the system validates the new password against the configured password security standards to ensure it is strong and compliant.

After validation succeeds, the CMS updates the user’s password in the database. The system then displays a success message confirming that the password has been changed. The user remains logged in and can continue using CMS with the assurance that their updated password is now in effect for future logins.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4a: Required Fields Are Left Blank

A logged-in user opens the **Change Password** form but accidentally leaves one or more required fields blank, such as the current password, new password, or confirmation field. The user submits the form expecting the password to be changed.

The CMS checks the submission and detects missing required fields. Because it cannot validate or complete a password change without all required inputs, the system rejects the request.

The CMS displays an error message indicating that required fields are missing and highlights (or otherwise indicates) the fields that must be completed. The system prevents the password change from proceeding until the user fills in all required fields and resubmits the request.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6a: Current Password Is Incorrect

A user opens the **Change Password** form, enters a new password they want to use, but accidentally mistypes their current password. The user submits the password change request.

The CMS verifies the current password by comparing it to the stored password in the database. The system determines that the provided current password does not match.

To prevent unauthorized password changes, the CMS rejects the request and displays an error message indicating that the current password is incorrect. The user’s password remains unchanged. The user can try again by entering the correct current password and resubmitting the request.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7a: New Password Does Not Meet Security Standards

A user enters their current password correctly and provides a new password that does not meet the CMS password security standards (for example, it is too short or lacks required complexity). The user submits the request.

The CMS verifies the current password successfully and then validates the new password. During validation, the system detects that the new password violates the configured security rules.

The CMS rejects the password change request and displays an error message indicating that the new password does not meet security standards. The system prevents the password update until the user provides a compliant new password and resubmits the request.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7b: New Password and Confirmation Do Not Match

A user opens the **Change Password** form and enters their current password. They choose a new password but accidentally type a different value in the confirmation field. The user submits the request.

The CMS compares the new password and confirmation values and determines that they do not match. To avoid setting an unintended password, the system rejects the request.

The CMS displays an error message indicating that the new password and confirmation do not match. The password is not changed. The user must re-enter matching values and resubmit the request to proceed.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 8a: Database Update Fails

A user submits a valid password change request: the current password is correct, and the new password meets all security standards. The CMS proceeds to update the password in the database.

During the database update step, an unexpected failure occurs (such as a database outage, connection timeout, or internal server error). The system cannot commit the password change.

The CMS stops the process, displays an error message indicating that the password could not be changed at this time, and logs the failure for administrator review. The user’s password remains unchanged, and the user must retry later after the issue is resolved.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 2a: User Is Not Authenticated (Session Expired)

A registered user intends to change their password and navigates to account/security settings. However, their session has expired or they are no longer authenticated (for example, due to inactivity). When the user attempts to access the **Change Password** option, the CMS detects that the user is not authenticated.

To protect account security, the CMS redirects the user to the login page and requires them to log in again. Only after successful authentication can the user return to the account settings area and proceed with the password change workflow.
