# Use Case UC-14: Enforce reviewer assignment limit (max 5 papers per reviewer)

**Goal in Context**: When an editor assigns referees to papers, the system enforces a limit of **5 assigned papers per reviewer** so reviewer workload remains fair and over-assignment is prevented.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: Subfunction  
**Primary Actor**: Editor (Registered User with Editor role)  
**Secondary Actors**: CMS Database  
**Trigger**: The editor attempts to assign a reviewer (referee) to a paper and the system checks the reviewer’s current assignment count.

## Success End Condition
* The system allows assignment only when the reviewer has fewer than 5 papers currently assigned; assignments that would exceed the limit are blocked with a clear message.

## Failed End Condition
* The system allows a reviewer to be assigned more than 5 papers, resulting in unfair workload distribution, or blocks valid assignments incorrectly.

## Preconditions
* The editor is logged in and has editor permissions.
* The paper is eligible for referee assignment.
* The system can determine how many papers are currently assigned to the targeted reviewer (by email/user record).
* The reviewer assignment limit is configured as 5 (system constraint).

## Main Success Scenario
1. The editor selects an eligible submitted paper and chooses **Assign Referees**.
2. The editor enters the reviewer’s email address and confirms the assignment.
3. The system looks up the reviewer’s current number of assigned papers.
4. The system determines the reviewer currently has fewer than 5 assigned papers.
5. The system records the assignment in the database.
6. The system displays confirmation that the reviewer was assigned successfully.

## Extensions
* **3a**: Reviewer has already reached the limit (5 assigned papers)  
    * **3a1**: The system blocks the assignment.
    * **3a2**: The system displays an error message indicating the reviewer has reached the maximum of 5 assigned papers.
    * **3a3**: The system does not create the assignment record.
* **3b**: Reviewer assignment count cannot be determined (lookup failure)  
    * **3b1**: The system displays an error message indicating assignment cannot be completed at this time.
    * **3b2**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
    * **3b3**: The system blocks the assignment (fail safe).
* **2a**: Editor attempts to assign multiple reviewers at once and some exceed the limit  
    * **2a1**: The system evaluates each reviewer’s assignment count.
    * **2a2**: The system assigns only the reviewers under the limit and blocks those at/over the limit (or blocks all if system requires all-or-nothing).
    * **2a3**: The system displays a summary indicating which reviewers were assigned and which were rejected due to the limit.
* **5a**: Database write fails after limit check  
    * **5a1**: The system displays an error message indicating the assignment could not be saved at this time.
    * **5a2**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
    * **5a3**: The system does not create a partial/duplicate assignment.
