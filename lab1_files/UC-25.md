# Use Case UC-25: Receive editor’s decision (accept/reject)

**Goal in Context**: An author receives the editor’s decision so they know whether their paper is accepted or rejected.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Author  
**Secondary Actors**: Editor (source of decision); CMS Database; Notification Service (Email/In-app)  
**Trigger**: The system records a final decision for the author’s paper (UC-24) and publishes/sends the decision to the author.

## Success End Condition
* The author is notified of the editor’s decision (Accepted/Rejected) and can view the decision in CMS (and/or via email notification), including any decision notes if provided.

## Failed End Condition
* The author does not receive or cannot view the decision due to delivery failures, incorrect contact information, authorization issues, or system errors.

## Preconditions
* The author has an account in CMS and is associated with the paper (as submitting author or listed author).
* The paper exists in CMS.
* The editor has recorded a final decision for the paper (Accepted or Rejected).
* The system is configured to communicate decisions to authors (in-app visibility and/or email notifications).
* The author’s contact email (if email is used) is valid.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The editor records a final decision (Accept/Reject) for a paper.
2. The system stores the decision and updates the paper status accordingly.
3. The system identifies the author(s) associated with the paper and their notification preferences (if applicable).
4. The system generates a decision notification that includes the decision outcome and relevant paper details.
5. The system delivers the notification to the author via the configured channel(s) (e.g., email and/or in-app notification).
6. The author accesses the decision:
   1. If in-app: the author logs into CMS and navigates to **My Submissions** (or paper details) to view the decision.
   2. If email: the author reads the notification email and may follow a link to CMS to view details.
7. The system displays the decision to the author (Accepted/Rejected) and any decision notes/comments if available.

## Extensions
* **5a**: Notification service fails (email/in-app cannot be delivered)  
    * **5a1**: The system keeps the decision stored and visible in the author’s CMS account (in-app).
    * **5a2**: The system logs the notification failure for administrator review.
    * **5a3**: The system retries delivery later or allows manual resend (if supported).
* **3a**: Author email is missing/invalid for email delivery  
    * **3a1**: The system falls back to in-app notification only (if supported).
    * **3a2**: The system logs the contact data issue and may prompt the author to update profile email.
* **6a**: Author is not authenticated when attempting to view decision in-app  
    * **6a1**: The system prompts the author to log in.
    * **6a2**: After login, the system returns the author to the submissions page or paper decision view.
* **6b**: Author attempts to view decision for a paper they are not associated with  
    * **6b1**: The system denies access and displays an authorization error.
    * **6b2**: The system logs the access attempt for administrator review.
* **2a**: Decision is not yet published/visible to authors (staged release)  
    * **2a1**: The system stores the decision but does not notify authors until the release time.
    * **2a2**: The author sees “Pending decision” until publication.
* **7a**: Decision notes are not available  
    * **7a1**: The system displays the decision outcome without notes.
