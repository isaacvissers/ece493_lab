# Use Case UC-29: Receive final schedule for an accepted paper

**Goal in Context**: An author of an accepted paper receives the final conference schedule so they know when and where they will present.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Author (of an accepted paper)  
**Secondary Actors**: Administrator/Editor (publishes schedule); CMS Database; Notification Service (Email/In-app); Web Browser  
**Trigger**: The schedule is finalized/published by an administrator/editor and the system releases schedule details to authors.

## Success End Condition
* The author receives access to the final schedule and can view their paper’s assigned presentation time and room.

## Failed End Condition
* The author cannot receive or view the final schedule due to schedule not being published, delivery failure, authorization issues, or system errors.

## Preconditions
* The author has a CMS account and is associated with a paper.
* The paper status is **Accepted**.
* A schedule exists and has been finalized/published for the conference.
* The author has permission to view the schedule for the conference.
* The system has a delivery mechanism (in-app schedule view and/or email notification).

## Main Success Scenario
1. The administrator/editor finalizes and publishes the conference schedule.
2. The system stores the schedule in the database as the official published schedule.
3. The system identifies authors of accepted papers and their associated scheduled presentation entries.
4. The system generates a schedule notification for the author (including paper title/ID, time, and room).
5. The system delivers the notification via configured channel(s) (e.g., email and/or in-app).
6. The author accesses the schedule:
   1. If in-app: the author logs into CMS and navigates to **My Submissions** or **Schedule**.
   2. If email: the author reads the email and optionally follows a link to CMS schedule view.
7. The system displays the author’s presentation details (time and room) for their accepted paper.
8. The author confirms when and where they will present.

## Extensions
* **1a**: Schedule is not yet finalized/published  
    * **1a1**: The author sees “Schedule not available yet” or “Pending schedule” in CMS.
    * **1a2**: No schedule notification is sent until publication.
* **5a**: Notification service fails  
    * **5a1**: The schedule remains accessible in CMS once published.
    * **5a2**: The system logs the notification failure and may retry later.
* **6a**: Author not authenticated when attempting to view schedule in-app  
    * **6a1**: The system prompts the author to log in.
    * **6a2**: After login, the system returns the author to schedule/submission view.
* **7a**: Author’s paper is accepted but not scheduled (missing assignment)  
    * **7a1**: The system displays “Unscheduled” for the paper and instructs the author to contact the organizer.
    * **7a2**: The system flags the missing assignment for admin/editor attention.
* **6b**: Author attempts to view schedule for a conference they are not associated with  
    * **6b1**: The system denies access and logs the attempt.
* **2a**: Schedule publication fails after finalization attempt  
    * **2a1**: The system displays an error to the admin/editor and does not release schedule to authors.
