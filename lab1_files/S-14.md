# UC-14 Scenario Narratives — Enforce Reviewer Assignment Limit (Max 5 Papers)

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-14: Enforce reviewer assignment limit**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

An editor is assigning referees to submitted papers in the Conference Management System (CMS). The editor selects an eligible paper and opens the **Assign Referees** interface. The editor enters a reviewer’s email address and confirms the assignment.

Before recording the assignment, the CMS checks the reviewer’s current workload. The system looks up how many papers are currently assigned to that reviewer. The CMS finds that the reviewer has fewer than five active assignments.

Because the reviewer is still below the workload limit, the CMS allows the assignment. The system records the reviewer-paper assignment in the database and confirms to the editor that the reviewer was assigned successfully. The reviewer’s workload count is now updated accordingly, helping maintain fair distribution across reviewers.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Reviewer Has Reached the Limit (5 Assigned Papers)

An editor attempts to assign a reviewer to a new paper by entering the reviewer’s email address and confirming the assignment. The CMS checks the reviewer’s current assignment count.

The system determines that the reviewer already has five papers assigned. Assigning another paper would exceed the workload limit and create an unfair distribution of review responsibilities.

To enforce fairness, the CMS blocks the assignment. The system displays an error message informing the editor that the reviewer has reached the maximum of five assigned papers. No assignment record is created, and the editor must choose a different reviewer or re-balance assignments in another way.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3b: Reviewer Assignment Count Cannot Be Determined

An editor enters a reviewer email and attempts to assign the reviewer to a paper. The CMS tries to look up the reviewer’s current assignment count, but an error occurs—such as a database connectivity issue or missing reviewer record mapping.

Because the system cannot verify whether the reviewer is under the assignment limit, it cannot safely allow the assignment without risking an over-assignment.

The CMS fails safely by blocking the assignment. It displays an error message indicating the assignment cannot be completed at this time. The system logs the failure for administrator review so the lookup problem can be diagnosed and corrected. The editor may retry later once the system can reliably retrieve reviewer assignment counts.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 2a: Assigning Multiple Reviewers Where Some Exceed the Limit

An editor selects a paper and attempts to assign multiple reviewers at once by entering several reviewer email addresses. The CMS evaluates each reviewer’s workload before saving the assignments.

The system checks each reviewer’s current assignment count. Some reviewers are under the limit, while one or more reviewers are already at the maximum of five assigned papers.

The CMS applies the assignment limit rules by allowing assignments for reviewers who are below the limit and blocking those who are already at the limit (or, if configured for all-or-nothing behavior, blocking the entire batch). The system then displays a summary that clearly indicates which reviewers were successfully assigned and which were rejected due to reaching the five-paper limit.

The editor can proceed with the successfully assigned reviewers and select replacements for any rejected reviewers.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Database Write Fails After Limit Check

An editor attempts to assign a reviewer who is below the assignment limit. The CMS checks the reviewer’s workload and confirms the reviewer has fewer than five assigned papers.

The system then attempts to record the assignment in the database. During this persistence step, a database error occurs, preventing the assignment from being saved.

The CMS displays an error message indicating that the assignment could not be saved at this time and logs the failure for administrator review. No assignment record is created, and the reviewer’s workload count is not changed. The editor may retry the assignment once the database issue is resolved.
