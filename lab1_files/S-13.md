# UC-13 Scenario Narratives — Assign Referees to Submitted Papers

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-13: Assign referees to submitted papers**.

---

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

An editor is logged in to the Conference Management System (CMS) and is preparing to move submitted papers into the review stage. The editor opens the list of submitted papers and selects a paper that needs reviewers.

The CMS displays the paper’s details along with an **Assign Referees** option. The editor chooses **Assign Referees**, and the system prompts the editor to enter one or more referee email addresses. The editor enters the email addresses of appropriate reviewers and confirms the assignment.

The CMS validates the email format for each entered address to ensure they are properly formed. After validation succeeds, the CMS records the referee assignments in the database, linking each referee email to the selected paper.

If the CMS supports notifications, the system sends email notifications to the newly assigned referees informing them that they have been assigned a paper to review and providing instructions or a link to access the paper within CMS.

Finally, the CMS displays a confirmation message to the editor that the referees were assigned successfully and updates the paper’s referee list to reflect the new assignments.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 1a: Editor Not Logged In or Lacks Editor Permissions

A user attempts to assign referees to a paper but is not logged in as an editor, or does not have the required editor permissions. The user navigates to the paper management area and tries to access the **Assign Referees** option.

The CMS checks the user’s authentication and authorization state and determines that the user is not permitted to assign referees. The system denies access to the assignment feature.

If the user is not logged in, the CMS redirects them to the login page. If the user is logged in but lacks the editor role, the CMS displays an authorization error indicating they do not have permission to assign referees.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 2a: Paper Not Eligible for Assignment

An editor selects a paper and attempts to assign referees, but the paper is not eligible for referee assignment. For example, the paper may be withdrawn, already under review with assignments locked, or in a status that does not permit assignment.

When the editor tries to open the assignment feature, the CMS checks the paper’s current status and detects it is not eligible. The system blocks the assignment action.

The CMS displays a message explaining that referees cannot be assigned to the paper in its current state. The editor must choose a different eligible submitted paper or change the paper’s status through an appropriate workflow (if allowed) before assigning referees.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6a: Referee Email Address Is Blank

An editor opens the **Assign Referees** form and attempts to submit referee assignments, but one or more referee email fields are left blank. The editor confirms the assignment expecting the system to proceed.

The CMS validates the assignment input and detects that an email address is missing. Since an assignment cannot be created without an email address, the system rejects the request.

The CMS displays an error message indicating that referee email is required and prevents the editor from completing the assignment until the missing email is provided.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7a: Referee Email Address Is Invalid Format

An editor enters one or more referee email addresses to assign reviewers. However, one of the email addresses is incorrectly formatted (for example, missing an “@” symbol or domain). The editor confirms the assignment.

The CMS validates the email formats and detects that one or more addresses are invalid. The system rejects the assignment attempt to avoid creating unusable referee records.

The CMS displays an error message identifying the invalid email address(es). The editor corrects the email address and resubmits the assignment. Once all emails are valid, the system proceeds.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7b: Duplicate Referee Email Entered

An editor enters a list of referee emails but accidentally includes the same email address more than once. The editor confirms the assignment.

The CMS detects duplicate email entries in the assignment list. Rather than creating multiple identical assignments, the system warns the editor and removes or ignores the duplicate entries.

The CMS proceeds to create assignments only for the unique email addresses and confirms the assignments were updated accordingly.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 8a: Referee Already Assigned to This Paper

An editor attempts to assign a referee to a paper, but the referee is already assigned (perhaps from a prior assignment round). The editor enters the referee email again and confirms the assignment.

The CMS checks existing assignments for the paper and detects that the referee email is already linked to the paper. To avoid duplication, the system does not create another assignment.

The system informs the editor that the referee is already assigned and keeps the existing assignment unchanged. Any other new referees in the list (if provided) can still be assigned normally.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 8b: Database Write Fails While Saving Assignments

An editor enters valid referee email addresses for an eligible submitted paper and confirms the assignment. The CMS validates the emails successfully and then attempts to store the referee assignments in the database.

During the save step, a database error occurs (such as a timeout or outage). The CMS cannot persist the assignments.

The system displays an error message indicating referees could not be assigned at this time and logs the failure for administrator review. The system does not partially apply assignments; the paper’s referee list remains unchanged so the editor can retry later.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 9a: Notification Service Fails

An editor assigns valid referees to a paper and the CMS records the assignments successfully in the database. The system then attempts to send notification emails to the assigned referees.

Due to an outage or error in the notification service, the emails cannot be sent. The CMS does not undo the assignments because the core assignment action succeeded.

Instead, the CMS displays a warning to the editor indicating that referee notifications could not be sent. The system logs the failure for administrator review. If the CMS supports it, the editor may retry sending notifications later.
