# Use Case UC-30: Announce final schedule on the CMS webpage

**Goal in Context**: A public user/attendee views the final conference schedule announced on the CMS webpage so they can plan attendance.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Public User / Attendee  
**Secondary Actors**: Administrator/Editor (publishes announcement); CMS Database; Web Publishing/Rendering Service (public webpage); Web Browser; CDN/Hosting (optional)  
**Trigger**: The conference schedule is finalized and an administrator/editor publishes it to the public CMS webpage.

## Success End Condition
* The final schedule is publicly available on the CMS webpage and the attendee can view it (e.g., by day/time/room/session) without needing restricted access.

## Failed End Condition
* The schedule is not visible publicly due to not being published, misconfiguration, permission issues, rendering failure, or system outage; the attendee cannot access the announcement/schedule page.

## Preconditions
* A final schedule exists and has been published internally (or approved for public release).
* The CMS supports a public webpage or public schedule endpoint/page.
* Public viewing is enabled for the schedule (policy/configuration permits).
* If the conference requires authentication for attendees, the public user has the required access (otherwise schedule is public).

## Main Success Scenario
1. An administrator/editor finalizes and publishes the conference schedule for public release.
2. The system stores the schedule as the official published schedule and marks it as **Publicly Visible**.
3. The system generates the public schedule webpage (HTML) or updates the public CMS landing page with a schedule announcement and link.
4. A public user/attendee visits the CMS webpage.
5. The attendee selects the schedule announcement or navigates to the **Schedule** page.
6. The system displays the final schedule in a readable format (e.g., by day, time, room, session).
7. The attendee reviews the schedule details and plans which sessions/papers to attend.

## Extensions
* **4a**: Schedule not yet publicly released  
    * **4a1**: The system displays “Schedule not available yet” (or hides the schedule link).
    * **4a2**: The attendee cannot view schedule details until release.
* **2a**: Administrator attempts to publish schedule publicly but publication fails  
    * **2a1**: The system shows an error to the admin/editor and does not expose a partial/broken schedule publicly.
    * **2a2**: The system logs the failure for admin review.
* **6a**: Public schedule rendering fails (template/data error)  
    * **6a1**: The system shows a friendly public error message (no stack traces).
    * **6a2**: The system logs the rendering failure for administrators.
* **5a**: Attendee attempts to access schedule but authentication is required (policy-dependent)  
    * **5a1**: The system redirects the attendee to a login/registration page.
    * **5a2**: After authentication, the system returns the attendee to the schedule page.
* **6b**: Schedule contains partial/unscheduled items  
    * **6b1**: The system clearly labels any “Unscheduled” items or omits them from public view per policy.
    * **6b2**: The schedule remains readable and consistent.
* **4b**: High traffic causes slow load  
    * **4b1**: The page shows a loading indicator and remains responsive.
    * **4b2**: If timeout occurs, the system shows a timeout message and logs performance issues.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High (public planning)  
* **Frequency**: Low–Medium (once per conference; may be updated)  
* **Open Issues**:  
  * Whether the public schedule includes paper titles only or also authors/abstracts is not specified.  
  * Whether the schedule is fully public or attendee-authenticated is not specified.  
  * Whether updates to the schedule should be versioned and time-stamped publicly is not specified.
