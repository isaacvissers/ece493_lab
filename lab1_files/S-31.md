# UC-31 Scenario Narratives — Register for the Conference (Authorized User)

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-31: Register for the conference**.

---

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

An authorized user wants to attend the conference and must register through the Conference Management System (CMS). The user logs into CMS and navigates to the **Conference Registration** area.

The system displays registration details, including required attendee information and any relevant rules such as registration dates and potential fees. The user completes the registration form by entering required details such as their name, affiliation, and contact information. The user confirms they want to register for the conference.

If payment is required, the system prompts the user to complete payment. The user provides payment information and completes the transaction successfully. The CMS validates the registration details and payment status.

Once validation succeeds, the CMS records the registration in the database and marks the user as **Registered** for the conference. The system displays a confirmation page summarizing the registration and provides any receipt or confirmation reference. The CMS also sends a confirmation notification to the user (via email and/or in-app).

The user is now registered and has attendee access as defined by conference policy.

## Alternative Path Narrative — Registration Window Closed (Precondition Fails)

A user logs into CMS and navigates to **Conference Registration** intending to register. However, the current date is outside the configured registration window.

The system checks the registration period and determines registration is closed. The CMS blocks the registration action and displays a message such as “Registration closed,” including relevant dates or instructions for contacting organizers if needed.

The user cannot complete registration unless registration is reopened by administrators.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — User Not Eligible/Authorized to Register (Precondition Fails)

A user attempts to register for the conference but does not meet eligibility rules (for example, the user is not authorized, not invited, or has a restricted role).

When the user opens the registration workflow, the CMS checks eligibility and denies access. The system displays an authorization or eligibility message explaining that the user cannot register at this time.

No registration record is created, and the user remains unregistered.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4a: Required Registration Fields Missing/Invalid

The user opens the registration form and submits it without completing all required fields (for example, leaving name blank or entering an invalid email format).

The CMS validates the form and detects missing or invalid fields. The system highlights the specific fields that need correction and prevents submission from completing. The user reviews the highlighted errors, enters valid information, and resubmits the form.

Once the form is corrected, the CMS proceeds with validation and completes registration successfully.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Payment Required but Payment Fails or is Cancelled (Optional)

The user fills out the registration form and proceeds to payment because the conference requires a registration fee. The system redirects the user to the payment process.

During payment, the transaction fails (for example, card declined) or the user cancels the payment. The payment service returns a failure response to CMS.

The CMS does not mark the user as registered. If the system supports a “Pending Payment” status, the registration may be stored as incomplete but clearly labeled as pending; otherwise, no registration is saved as successful. The system displays an error message and allows the user to retry payment later.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7a: User Already Registered

A user who is already registered returns to the **Conference Registration** area and attempts to register again.

The CMS checks the database and detects an existing registration record for the user. The system prevents duplicate registration and instead displays the user’s current registration status, such as “You are already registered.”

The user can view their registration details but cannot create a duplicate registration entry.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7b: Database Write Fails While Saving Registration

The user completes the registration form and (if required) successfully completes payment. The CMS validates the data and attempts to save the registration record.

During the save operation, a database error occurs and the registration cannot be written to storage. The CMS displays an error message indicating that registration could not be saved. The system logs the failure for administrators to investigate.

The user remains unregistered and may retry registration later once the system is functioning.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 9a: Confirmation Notification Fails After Registration is Saved

The user completes registration successfully and the CMS saves the registration record, marking the user as registered.

After saving, the system attempts to send a confirmation notification (email or in-app). The notification service fails due to an outage or delivery issue.

Even though the notification fails, the registration remains saved and the user is still registered. The CMS logs the notification failure and may retry sending the confirmation later. The user can verify registration status by viewing their account or registration summary within CMS.
