# UC-20 Scenario Narratives — Access Review Form for Assigned Papers

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-20: Access review form for assigned papers**.

---

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

A reviewer logs into the Conference Management System (CMS) to complete paper evaluations. From the reviewer dashboard, the reviewer navigates to **My Assigned Papers**, where the system lists papers assigned to the reviewer that are eligible for review.

The reviewer selects a paper from the list. The CMS displays the paper details and provides an option to **Open Review Form** (or **Start Review**). The reviewer chooses this option.

Before showing the form, the CMS verifies that the reviewer is authorized to review the selected paper, ensuring the assignment exists and is accepted. The system then retrieves the configured review form and checks whether the reviewer has an existing saved review draft for that paper.

The CMS displays the review form to the reviewer. If a draft exists, the form is pre-populated with previously saved inputs; otherwise, it is blank and ready for the reviewer to begin entering their evaluation.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 1a: Reviewer Not Authenticated (Session Expired)

A reviewer attempts to open the review form but their session has expired, or they are not logged in. When the reviewer navigates to **My Assigned Papers** or clicks **Open Review Form**, the CMS detects the user is not authenticated.

The system prompts the reviewer to log in. After successful authentication, the CMS returns the reviewer to the paper details page (or directly to the review form) so they can continue the intended action without losing context.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: No Assigned Papers Available for Review

A reviewer logs into CMS and opens **My Assigned Papers** expecting to see assignments. The CMS retrieves the reviewer’s assignments but finds that none are currently eligible for review (for example, no assignments exist, or all assignments are pending/rejected, or review is closed).

The system displays a message indicating that there are no assigned papers available for review. The reviewer can return to the dashboard or wait until assignments are provided.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7a: Reviewer Attempts to Access a Paper Not Assigned to Them

A reviewer tries to access a paper’s review form by navigating directly to a URL or selecting a paper that is not in their assignment list (for example, through a shared link).

The CMS checks authorization and determines that the reviewer is not assigned to that paper. The system denies access to the review form and displays an authorization error. No review information is displayed or editable.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7b: Assignment Exists but Is Not Accepted (Pending/Rejected)

A reviewer has an invitation for a paper, but has not accepted it yet (or has rejected it). The reviewer attempts to open the review form anyway.

The CMS checks the assignment status and determines it is not accepted. The system denies access to the review form and informs the reviewer that they must accept the invitation before they can review the paper. The reviewer must accept first, after which the paper will become eligible for review form access.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 8a: Review Form Configuration Is Missing/Unavailable

A reviewer selects an assigned and accepted paper and clicks **Open Review Form**. The CMS verifies authorization successfully, but then attempts to load the review form configuration.

Due to a configuration issue (such as missing rubric fields, a disabled form, or an admin misconfiguration), the system cannot retrieve a valid review form. The CMS displays an error indicating that the review form is not available at this time.

The system logs the configuration failure for administrator review so the issue can be corrected. The reviewer is unable to proceed with the review until the form is restored.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 8b: Database Retrieval Fails When Loading Review Form or Saved Draft

A reviewer opens an assigned paper and requests the review form. The CMS verifies authorization, but while retrieving the review form or the reviewer’s saved draft review, a database error occurs (such as a timeout or outage).

The CMS cannot load the form. The system displays an error indicating that the review form cannot be loaded at this time and logs the failure for administrator review. The reviewer is instructed to retry later when the system is available.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 0a: Review Period Is Closed (Deadline Passed)

A reviewer attempts to open a review form for an assigned paper after the review period has closed. The CMS verifies the reviewer’s assignment, but checks the review schedule and determines that the deadline has passed.

The system blocks access to the review form for submission or editing and informs the reviewer that the review period is closed. Depending on policy, the system may still allow read-only access to previously submitted reviews, but the reviewer cannot enter or change review content once the period is closed.
