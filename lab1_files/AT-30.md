# Acceptance Test Suite — UC-30 Announce Final Schedule on the CMS Webpage

## Scope
Validate that a public user/attendee can access the **final schedule announcement** and view the **published schedule** on the CMS public webpage to plan attendance, and that CMS:
- publishes schedule to a public webpage when enabled,
- shows a clear announcement/link on the CMS webpage,
- renders schedule as readable HTML for public viewing,
- handles “not yet released” state properly,
- handles publication failures and rendering failures safely (no broken/partial output),
- supports policy-dependent authentication requirements,
- handles partial/unscheduled items appropriately,
- degrades gracefully under heavy traffic/performance constraints.

Covers UC-30 extensions (4a, 2a, 6a, 5a, 6b, 4b).

## Assumptions / Notes
- “Public webpage” may be a CMS landing page or dedicated schedule URL.
- Whether schedule is truly public or attendee-authenticated is policy-dependent; tests cover both.
- Public schedule content is assumed to include at least time/room/session/paper title (exact fields may vary).

## Test Data
- **Conference**: `CONF-08`
- **Published schedule**: exists and is marked **Publicly Visible**
- **Not publicly released schedule**: `CONF-09` (draft or published but not public)
- **Partial schedule**: `CONF-10` (contains some unscheduled items or incomplete entries)
- Users:
  - **Public user**: anonymous (not logged in)
  - **Attendee user** (if auth required): `attendee1@example.com`
  - **Admin/editor**: `admin1@example.com` / `editor1@example.com`
- Failure simulations:
  - Public publication failure (DB/publish service failure)
  - Rendering/template error on public schedule page
  - High traffic / slow load / timeout conditions

# Test Cases

## AT-UC30-01 — When schedule is publicly published, CMS homepage shows announcement/link (Happy Path)
**Objective:** Ensure the schedule is announced on CMS webpage.  
**Preconditions:** `CONF-08` schedule is published and marked **Publicly Visible**.  
**Steps:**
1. Open the CMS public homepage (or conference landing page) as an anonymous user.
2. Locate schedule announcement section.
3. Click the schedule link.
**Expected Results:**
- Announcement is visible and clearly indicates the final schedule is available.
- Link navigates to the public schedule page successfully.

## AT-UC30-02 — Public schedule page renders readable HTML with time/room details (Happy Path)
**Objective:** Validate schedule HTML display for attendees.  
**Preconditions:** `CONF-08` schedule is publicly visible.  
**Steps:**
1. Open public schedule page.
2. Inspect schedule layout (by day/time/room/session).
**Expected Results:**
- Schedule loads successfully and is readable.
- Entries include key information (at minimum: time + room, plus session/paper identifiers per design).
- No broken HTML or missing critical fields for scheduled entries.

---

## AT-UC30-03 — Schedule not publicly released: page/link is hidden or “Schedule not available yet” shown (Extension 4a)
**Objective:** Ensure correct behavior before public release.  
**Preconditions:** `CONF-09` schedule not marked publicly visible.  
**Steps:**
1. Visit CMS homepage / conference landing page for `CONF-09`.
2. Attempt to access the schedule page (via UI or direct URL).
**Expected Results:**
- Either schedule link is not shown, OR a message “Schedule not available yet” is displayed.
- No draft/private schedule content is exposed publicly.

---

## AT-UC30-04 — Publication failure: schedule is not exposed publicly and announcement not incorrectly updated (Extension 2a)
**Objective:** Ensure failed publish does not leak partial/broken schedule.  
**Preconditions:** Admin attempts to publish schedule publicly with publish failure simulated.  
**Steps:**
1. Admin triggers “Publish schedule to public webpage” for `CONF-08` (or a test conference).
2. Simulate publication failure during operation.
3. Visit public homepage and schedule URL.
**Expected Results:**
- Public schedule page is not updated to a broken/partial state.
- Homepage announcement is not shown as successful if publish failed.
- System logs the publication failure for admin review.
- Public user sees “not available yet” or previous stable state.

---

## AT-UC30-05 — Rendering failure: public schedule shows friendly error without sensitive details (Extension 6a)
**Objective:** Ensure safe, user-friendly failure.  
**Preconditions:** Schedule is public; simulate template/data rendering error on public schedule page.  
**Steps:**
1. Open public schedule page.
2. Trigger rendering error.
**Expected Results:**
- System shows a friendly public error message (“Schedule cannot be displayed right now”).
- No stack traces, internal URLs, database errors, or sensitive details shown.
- Failure is logged for admins.

---

## AT-UC30-06 — Authentication required policy: anonymous user is redirected to login, then returned (Extension 5a, if applicable)
**Objective:** Validate auth-required schedule access.  
**Preconditions:** Conference policy requires authentication to view schedule.  
**Steps:**
1. As anonymous user, open schedule link/page.
2. Confirm redirect to login/registration.
3. Log in as `attendee1@example.com`.
**Expected Results:**
- Anonymous user is redirected to login/registration.
- After login, user returns to the schedule page.
- Schedule displays normally after authentication.

---

## AT-UC30-07 — Partial/unscheduled items: schedule remains readable and incomplete items are labeled or omitted per policy (Extension 6b)
**Objective:** Ensure partial schedule is handled in public view.  
**Preconditions:** `CONF-10` schedule includes unscheduled or incomplete items.  
**Steps:**
1. Open public schedule page for `CONF-10`.
2. Locate incomplete/unscheduled items.
**Expected Results (Acceptable outcomes):**
- **Option A:** Incomplete items are shown but clearly labeled “Unscheduled” / “TBD”.  
- **Option B:** Incomplete items are omitted from public schedule (if policy requires only finalized items).  
In either case, schedule is still readable and consistent; no crashes.

---

## AT-UC30-08 — High traffic / slow load: page remains responsive or fails gracefully with timeout message (Extension 4b)
**Objective:** Validate performance degradation behavior.  
**Preconditions:** Simulate high traffic or slow backend on schedule page.  
**Steps:**
1. Open schedule page under load.
2. Observe load indicators and response behavior.
**Expected Results:**
- System shows a loading indicator while retrieving/rendering.
- Schedule loads successfully within acceptable time, OR
- If timeout occurs, a friendly timeout message is shown.
- Performance issues are logged for investigation.

# Exit Criteria (Definition of Done for UC-30)
UC-30 is accepted when:
- Public schedule announcement/link appears when schedule is publicly released (AT-UC30-01), and
- Public schedule renders readable HTML with expected information (AT-UC30-02), and
- Not-yet-released schedules are not exposed publicly (AT-UC30-03), and
- Publication and rendering failures are handled safely and do not leak sensitive details (AT-UC30-04, AT-UC30-05), and
- Authentication-required policy works correctly if enabled (AT-UC30-06), and
- Partial schedules are handled clearly (AT-UC30-07), and
- Performance under load is acceptable or fails gracefully (AT-UC30-08).
