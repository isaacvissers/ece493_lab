# Use Case UC-02: Validate registration email

**Goal in Context**: When a user attempts to register, the system validates that the provided email address is correctly formatted and not already registered, preventing invalid or duplicate accounts.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: Subfunction  
**Primary Actor**: User (Public User / Guest)  
**Secondary Actors**: CMS Database  
**Trigger**: The user submits the registration form containing an email address.

## Success End Condition
* The system confirms the email is valid in format and unique in the database, allowing registration to continue.

## Failed End Condition
* The system rejects the email and prevents registration from continuing, displaying an error message explaining the issue.

## Preconditions
* The user is on the registration form page.
* The user has entered an email address into the registration form.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The user enters an email address into the registration form.
2. The user submits the registration form.
3. The system checks the email format to confirm it is valid.
4. The system queries the CMS database to determine whether the email already exists.
5. The system confirms the email is unique and not currently registered.
6. The system allows the registration process to continue.

## Extensions
* **3a**: Email format is invalid  
    * **3a1**: The system displays an error message indicating the email format is invalid.
    * **3a2**: The system prevents registration from continuing until the email is corrected.

    * **4a1**: The system displays an error message indicating the email is already registered.
    * **4a2**: The system prevents registration from continuing until a different email is provided.
* **4b**: Database query fails  
    * **4b1**: The system displays an error message indicating the system cannot validate the email at this time.
    * **4b2**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
