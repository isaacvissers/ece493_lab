# Use Case UC-08: Submit paper manuscript

**Goal in Context**: An author submits a paper manuscript through CMS so the paper is recorded and can enter the conference review process.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Author (Registered User)  
**Secondary Actors**: CMS Database; File Storage Service (for manuscript upload, if separate from DB)  
**Trigger**: The author selects the option to submit a new paper manuscript.

## Success End Condition
* The manuscript metadata and source file are validated and stored, and the author receives confirmation that the submission has been successfully recorded in CMS.

## Failed End Condition
* The manuscript is not submitted (or not fully recorded), and the author receives an error message explaining what must be corrected or why the submission failed.

## Preconditions
* The author is registered and logged in.
* The manuscript submission feature is available.
* The author has a manuscript file ready in an accepted format (PDF, Word, or LaTeX) and within the size limit (≤ 7MB).

## Main Success Scenario
1. The author navigates to their home page and selects **Submit Paper** (new manuscript submission).
2. The system redirects the author to the manuscript submission page and displays the submission form.
3. The author enters the required manuscript information (e.g., author names/affiliations/contact info, abstract, keywords, and main source) and uploads the manuscript file.
4. The author submits the manuscript submission form.
5. The system validates that all required fields are complete and properly formatted.
6. The system validates that the uploaded file type is accepted (PDF, Word, or LaTeX) and the file size is within the limit.
7. The system stores the manuscript metadata and file in the database/storage.
8. The system displays a success message confirming the submission was recorded.
9. The system redirects the author to their home page.
