# UC-32 Scenario Narratives — View Conference Price List on the CMS Webpage

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-32: View conference price list**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

A guest or registered user is considering attending the conference and wants to understand the costs before paying. The user opens the Conference Management System (CMS) webpage using a web browser and looks for pricing information. The user selects a **Pricing/Fees** link or navigates directly to the **Price List** page.

The CMS retrieves the current conference price list from its configuration or database. The system renders the price list into a clear, readable webpage layout—commonly as a table with fee categories such as registration type (e.g., student, professional) and applicable rates (e.g., early/regular), depending on what the conference provides.

The user reviews the displayed price list, compares pricing options, and understands the costs required to register. With this information, the user can decide whether to proceed to conference registration and payment.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 2a: Price List Not Available / Not Published Yet

A user opens the CMS webpage and navigates to the **Price List** page expecting to see conference fees. The CMS checks for the published price list and finds that it has not been published or is not configured yet.

Instead of displaying an empty or misleading page, the system shows a clear message such as “Price list not available yet.” The CMS does not show outdated or partial information as if it were current pricing.

The user cannot view conference fees until an administrator publishes the price list. The user may try again later or contact organizers for pricing details.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Price List Exists but Contains Missing/Invalid Entries

A user navigates to the **Price List** page. The CMS successfully retrieves pricing data, but some entries are incomplete (for example, a workshop fee is not set) or contain invalid values.

The system renders the price list, showing all valid prices. For missing items, the CMS clearly labels them as “TBD” or omits them from the public display according to conference policy. The page remains readable and does not crash.

The CMS logs the pricing data issue for administrators (if logging is supported) so it can be corrected. The user still learns the available fees while recognizing that some values may not yet be finalized.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4a: Rendering Failure or Webpage Error

A user attempts to view the **Price List** page, but the CMS encounters an error while generating the page—such as a template error, a service outage, or corrupted configuration data that prevents the page from rendering.

Rather than displaying a broken page or exposing internal details, the CMS shows a friendly error message indicating that pricing could not be displayed at this time. The system does not reveal internal stack traces or sensitive system information.

The CMS logs the rendering failure for administrators to investigate. The user may retry later once the issue is resolved.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 2b: Access Restricted to Registered Users (Policy-Dependent)

A guest user attempts to view conference pricing, but the conference policy restricts the price list to registered/authenticated users only.

When the guest navigates to the **Price List** page, the CMS detects the user is not logged in. The system redirects the user to the login/registration page or displays a message explaining that login is required to view pricing.

After the user logs in (or creates an account), the CMS returns them to the **Price List** page. The system then displays the price list normally, allowing the user to review costs before paying.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 1a: High Traffic Causes Slow Load

Shortly before the registration deadline, many users visit the CMS webpage to check the conference price list. The page experiences heavy traffic and loads more slowly than usual.

The CMS remains responsive and shows a loading indicator while retrieving and rendering pricing data. If the system completes within acceptable time, the price list page loads normally and the user can review prices.

If performance constraints cause a timeout, the CMS displays a friendly timeout message and logs the performance issue for administrators. The user can retry later or refresh the page once traffic decreases.
