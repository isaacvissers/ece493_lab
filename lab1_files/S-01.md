# UC-01 Scenario Narratives — Register an Account

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-01: Register an account**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

A public user visits the Conference Management System (CMS) website and decides to create an account so they can access features such as submitting papers, reviewing assignments, or registering as an attendee. From the homepage, the user selects the **Register** option. The system responds by redirecting the user to the registration page and displaying a registration form.

The user enters their required registration information, including a valid email address and a password that meets the system’s password security standards. Once the form is completed, the user submits it.

The CMS validates the form input. First, it checks that the email address is properly formatted and that the password satisfies the password rules. Next, it checks the database to confirm the email address has not already been used for another account.

After all validations pass, the system creates a new user account and stores the user’s information in the CMS database. The system then displays a confirmation that registration was successful and redirects the user to the login page so they can sign in and begin using CMS features.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Invalid Email Format

A public user opens the CMS registration form and enters an email address, but the email format is incorrect (for example, missing an “@” symbol or domain). The user submits the form expecting to proceed.

The CMS validates the form fields and detects that the email address format is invalid. Instead of creating the account, the system rejects the submission and displays an error message indicating that the email field is invalid.

The user reviews the message, corrects the email address to a valid format, and submits the form again. The system re-validates the corrected input and, if no other issues exist, continues with registration processing.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5b: Password Does Not Meet Security Standards

A public user opens the CMS registration form and enters a password that does not meet the system’s password security requirements (for example, too short or missing required character types). The user submits the form to register.

The CMS validates the submitted data and determines that the password does not satisfy the password security standards. The system blocks account creation and displays an error message explaining that the password field is invalid.

The user updates the password to meet the required standard and resubmits the form. The CMS validates the updated password and, if the email and other fields are also valid, continues with the registration process.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6a: Email Already Registered

A public user attempts to register for CMS using an email address that has already been used to create an account. The user fills in the form and submits it as normal.

The CMS validates the email format and password rules successfully, then checks the database for email uniqueness. The system finds that the email address is already associated with an existing user account.

The system rejects the registration attempt and displays an error message indicating that the email address is already registered or already in use. The user then enters a different email address that is not registered and resubmits the form. The CMS repeats validation and, if all requirements are met, proceeds with successful registration.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7a: Database Error While Storing User Information

A public user completes the registration form correctly and submits it. The CMS validates the email format, password rules, and confirms that the email address is unique.

When the system attempts to store the new user account in the CMS database, an unexpected database error occurs (for example, a connection failure or server-side issue). The system cannot complete account creation.

The CMS stops the registration workflow and displays an error message indicating that registration could not be completed at this time. The system logs the failure so that an administrator can investigate the issue later. The user remains unregistered and must retry registration after the system becomes available again.
