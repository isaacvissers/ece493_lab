# UC-02 Scenario Narratives — Validate Registration Email

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-02: Validate registration email**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

A user is in the process of registering for an account in the Conference Management System (CMS). While completing the registration form, the user enters an email address and submits the form to proceed with account creation.

When the form is submitted, the CMS immediately evaluates the email address. First, the system checks the email format to ensure it follows a valid structure (for example, it contains the required “@” symbol and a domain portion). Since the email is properly formatted, the CMS continues the validation process.

Next, the CMS queries the CMS database to determine whether the email address already exists as a registered account. The database returns no matching record for the submitted email address.

With both conditions satisfied—valid format and uniqueness—the system confirms the email is acceptable and allows the registration workflow to continue without interruption.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Email Format is Invalid

A user attempts to register for CMS and enters an email address in the registration form. However, the email address is not formatted correctly (for example, it is missing the “@” symbol or contains invalid characters). The user submits the registration form expecting to continue.

Upon submission, the CMS performs its email validation check and immediately detects that the email format is invalid. The system does not attempt to check uniqueness in the database because the format requirement has already failed.

The CMS rejects the submission and displays an error message informing the user that the email format is invalid. The system prevents the registration process from continuing until the user corrects the email field and submits again with a valid format.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4a: Email Already Exists in the Database

A user fills out the CMS registration form using an email address that is already associated with an existing CMS account. The user submits the form to proceed with registration.

The CMS first validates that the email format is correct. Since the email structure is valid, the system proceeds to check uniqueness by querying the CMS database.

The database returns a match, indicating that the email is already registered. The CMS rejects the registration attempt and displays an error message explaining that the email address is already in use. The system blocks the registration process from continuing until the user provides a different email address that is not currently registered.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4b: Database Query Fails

A user submits the CMS registration form with an email address that appears to be properly formatted. The CMS validates the email format successfully and then attempts to confirm uniqueness by querying the CMS database.

During this step, the database query fails due to an unexpected issue such as a database connection failure, timeout, or server-side error. As a result, the system cannot confirm whether the email is already registered.

Because uniqueness cannot be verified, the CMS does not allow the registration process to continue. Instead, it displays an error message indicating that the system cannot validate the email at this time. The CMS also logs the failure so that an administrator can investigate and restore normal service. The user remains on the registration page and must retry later once the system is functioning correctly.
