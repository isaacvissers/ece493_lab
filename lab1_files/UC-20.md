# Use Case UC-20: Access review form for assigned papers

**Goal in Context**: A reviewer accesses the review form for papers assigned to them so they can evaluate the submission and provide a review.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Reviewer (Referee)  
**Secondary Actors**: CMS Database; Authentication Service; File Storage (manuscript access)  
**Trigger**: The reviewer selects an assigned paper and chooses the option to start/continue a review.

## Success End Condition
* The review form for the selected assigned paper is displayed to the reviewer, allowing them to enter review information and proceed with evaluation.

## Failed End Condition
* The reviewer cannot access the review form (due to missing assignment, lack of acceptance, closed review period, system errors), preventing the reviewer from completing their evaluation.

## Preconditions
* The reviewer is logged into CMS.
* The reviewer has an **accepted** assignment for the paper (or is otherwise authorized to review it).
* The paper exists and is available for review.
* The review form (template/fields) is configured and available.
* The review period is open (if the system enforces deadlines/periods).

## Main Success Scenario
1. The reviewer logs into CMS.
2. The reviewer navigates to **My Assigned Papers** (reviewer dashboard).
3. The system displays the list of papers assigned to the reviewer that are eligible for review.
4. The reviewer selects a paper from the list.
5. The system displays the paper details and provides an option to **Open Review Form** (or **Start Review**).
6. The reviewer selects **Open Review Form**.
7. The system verifies the reviewer is authorized to review the selected paper.
8. The system retrieves the review form for the paper and any existing saved review draft (if present).
9. The system displays the review form to the reviewer, ready for input.
