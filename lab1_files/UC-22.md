# Use Case UC-22: Validate review form fields (no invalid characters / no blanks)

**Goal in Context**: The system validates review form fields to ensure there are **no invalid characters** and **no required blanks**, so stored reviews are clean, complete, and suitable for editor decision-making.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: Subfunction (System Validation)  
**Primary Actor**: System (CMS)  
**Secondary Actors**: Reviewer; CMS Database; Editor (consumer of clean data)  
**Trigger**: A reviewer saves a review draft or submits a completed review, and the system runs validation on the review form fields.

## Success End Condition
* The system detects and rejects invalid review inputs (blanks in required fields, invalid characters) and accepts valid inputs, ensuring only clean and complete review data is stored/submitted.

## Failed End Condition
* Invalid review data is accepted/stored, or valid data is incorrectly rejected, resulting in corrupted review records or blocked reviewer workflow.

## Preconditions
* A review form exists for a paper and is accessible by an authorized reviewer.
* The system has validation rules for review fields (required fields and allowed character sets).
* The reviewer is creating/updating a review (draft save or submission).
* The system can present validation errors back to the reviewer.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The reviewer enters review information into the review form fields.
2. The reviewer selects **Save Draft** or **Submit Review**.
3. The system validates each relevant field according to configured rules:
   * required fields are not blank (or not blank on submission),
   * text fields contain only allowed characters (no invalid characters),
   * values conform to defined formats/ranges (if applicable).
4. The system detects no validation errors.
5. The system stores the review data (as draft or submitted) in the database.
6. The system confirms to the reviewer that the review was saved/submitted successfully.

## Extensions
* **3a**: Required field is blank  
    * **3a1**: The system blocks the save/submit action (or blocks submission if drafts allow partials).
    * **3a2**: The system highlights the blank required field(s) and displays an error summary.
    * **3a3**: The reviewer corrects the blanks and retries.
* **3b**: Field contains invalid characters  
    * **3b1**: The system blocks the save/submit action.
    * **3b2**: The system highlights the field(s) and explains which characters are invalid (or the rule violated).
    * **3b3**: The reviewer edits the input and retries.
* **3c**: Multiple validation errors across fields  
    * **3c1**: The system presents a consolidated error summary.
    * **3c2**: The system highlights all invalid fields.
    * **3c3**: The reviewer corrects errors and retries.
* **2a**: Reviewer input exceeds maximum length for a field (if applicable)  
    * **2a1**: The system blocks the save/submit action.
    * **2a2**: The system informs the reviewer of the maximum allowed length and highlights the field.
* **5a**: Database write fails after validation passes  
    * **5a1**: The system displays an error indicating the review could not be saved/submitted at this time.
    * **5a2**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
    * **5a3**: The review is not stored/updated; reviewer can retry.
* **3d**: Validation rules unavailable (configuration error)  
    * **3d1**: The system blocks save/submit (fail safe).
    * **3d2**: The system informs the reviewer the action cannot be completed at this time.
    * **3d3**: The system logs the configuration issue for administrator review.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: High (every save/submit event during review period)  
* **Open Issues**:  
  * Exact definition of “invalid characters” is not specified (e.g., HTML tags, control chars, emojis).  
  * Whether drafts can be saved with blanks is not specified; this use case assumes required blanks are enforced at least on submission.  
  * Field length limits and which fields are required are not specified.
