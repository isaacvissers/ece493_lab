# Use Case UC-31: Register for the conference (authorized user)

**Goal in Context**: An authorized user registers for the conference so they can attend (and gain attendee access where applicable).  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Authorized User (Registered user eligible to attend)  
**Secondary Actors**: Administrator (defines eligibility/registration window); CMS Database; Payment Service (optional); Email/Notification Service  
**Trigger**: The authorized user selects **Conference Registration** and chooses to register.

## Success End Condition
* The user is successfully registered for the conference and receives confirmation (in-app and/or email). The system records the registration status and enables attendee access/permissions as configured.

## Failed End Condition
* The user cannot complete registration due to ineligibility, closed registration window, invalid/missing information, payment failure (if applicable), or system errors; registration is not recorded (or is clearly marked incomplete/pending).

## Preconditions
* The user has a CMS account and is authenticated.
* The user is authorized/eligible to register for the conference (role/status allows registration).
* Conference registration is open (within registration window).
* The system has a registration mechanism (form/workflow) and can persist registration records.
* If payment is required, a payment method/service is available.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The authorized user logs into CMS.
2. The user navigates to **Conference Registration**.
3. The system displays registration information and requirements (dates, fees if any, attendee details needed).
4. The user enters required registration details (e.g., name, affiliation, contact email, attendance type) and confirms they want to register.
5. *(Optional)* If payment is required, the system prompts for payment and the user completes payment successfully.
6. The system validates the submitted registration data.
7. The system records the user’s registration in the database and marks them as **Registered** for the conference.
8. The system displays a confirmation message and provides a registration receipt/summary.
9. The system sends a confirmation notification to the user (email and/or in-app).
10. The user now has attendee status/access per conference policy (e.g., ability to view attendee-only content).

## Extensions
* **Precondition fails — registration window closed**  
    * **A1**: The user attempts to register outside the registration window.
    * **A2**: The system blocks registration and displays “Registration closed” with relevant dates.
* **Precondition fails — user not eligible/authorized to register**  
    * **B1**: The system determines the user does not meet eligibility rules.
    * **B2**: The system blocks registration and displays an authorization/eligibility message.
* **4a**: Required registration fields missing/invalid  
    * **4a1**: The system highlights missing/invalid fields and prevents submission.
    * **4a2**: The user corrects fields and resubmits.
* **5a**: Payment required but payment fails or is cancelled (optional)  
    * **5a1**: The payment service returns failure or user cancels.
    * **5a2**: The system does not mark the user as registered (or marks as **Pending Payment** if supported).
    * **5a3**: The system shows an error and allows retry.
* **7a**: User is already registered  
    * **7a1**: The system detects existing registration.
    * **7a2**: The system prevents duplicate registration and shows current registration status.
* **7b**: Database write fails while saving registration  
    * **7b1**: The system displays an error indicating registration could not be saved.
    * **7b2**: The system logs the failure for admin review.
    * **7b3**: The user remains unregistered (no partial state recorded as successful).
* **9a**: Confirmation notification fails after registration is saved  
    * **9a1**: Registration remains saved.
    * **9a2**: System logs notification failure and may retry later.
