# UC-11 Scenario Narratives — Validate Paper Submission Fields

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-11: Validate paper submission fields**.

---

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

An author is completing a paper submission in the Conference Management System (CMS). After entering the required manuscript metadata and uploading a manuscript file, the author clicks **Submit** to finalize the submission.

The CMS immediately validates the submission data to catch errors early. The system checks that all required submission fields are completed and that no required fields are blank. It then validates the author’s contact email address to ensure it has a proper email format. Next, the CMS confirms that a manuscript file has been provided and that the file is in one of the accepted formats (PDF, Word, or LaTeX).

Because the author’s submission contains no missing required fields, includes a valid email, and includes a file in an accepted type, all validations pass. The CMS confirms validation success and allows the submission workflow to proceed to recording the submission and displaying submission confirmation.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 2a: Required Fields Are Missing (Blanks)

An author fills out the submission form but accidentally leaves one or more required fields blank—such as missing the abstract, omitting an author name, or leaving the keywords empty. The author attempts to finalize the submission by clicking **Submit**.

The CMS validates the submission and detects that required fields are missing. Because incomplete submissions should not proceed into the review process, the system blocks final submission.

The CMS displays an error message identifying which required fields are missing and instructs the author to complete them. The author remains on the submission page and must fill in the missing information before submitting again.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Contact Email Is Invalid

An author completes the submission form and attempts to submit it, but the contact email address is incorrectly formatted (for example, it is missing a domain or contains invalid characters).

The CMS validates the submission fields. Even if other required fields are present, the system detects that the email format is invalid. Since contact information must be reliable for conference communication, the CMS rejects the submission attempt.

The system displays an error message indicating the email address is invalid and prevents final submission until the author corrects the email field. The author updates the email address and resubmits.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4a: Manuscript File Is Missing

An author completes the required text fields of the submission form and clicks **Submit** to finalize the submission. However, the author has not uploaded or selected a manuscript file.

The CMS validation process checks for the presence of a manuscript file and detects that none is attached to the submission. Since the manuscript file is required for review, the CMS blocks the submission.

The system displays an error message indicating that a manuscript file is required and prompts the author to upload a file. The author must upload a manuscript before the system will allow the submission to proceed.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4b: Manuscript File Type Is Not Accepted

An author uploads a file and completes the submission fields, then clicks **Submit**. However, the uploaded file is not in an accepted format (for example, a `.txt` file or an image).

The CMS validates the submission, detects that the uploaded file type is not allowed, and blocks final submission. The system displays an error message listing the accepted file formats (PDF, Word, LaTeX).

The author replaces the file with a valid manuscript format and retries submission. Once the file type is correct and other fields are valid, the submission can proceed.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Multiple Validation Errors Occur

An author attempts to submit a manuscript but several issues exist at the same time—for example, the abstract is blank, the contact email is invalid, and the uploaded file is an unsupported type.

When the author clicks **Submit**, the CMS runs validation checks and detects multiple failures. Instead of failing one field at a time, the system presents the author with a clear list of all validation errors (or highlights each problematic field with messages).

The CMS blocks final submission until all issues are resolved. The author corrects the missing fields, fixes the email, and uploads a valid file type. Once all problems are addressed, the author can submit successfully.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 2b: Author Saves as Draft Despite Validation Issues (If Allowed)

An author is working on a submission but has not completed all required fields or may have an invalid email or file. The author is not ready to finalize the submission, but wants to save progress.

Instead of clicking **Submit**, the author selects **Save Draft**. The CMS saves the current state of the submission without requiring all final validations to pass. The system confirms that the draft has been saved successfully.

The author can return later to complete missing fields, correct the email address, and upload a compliant manuscript file before attempting final submission.
