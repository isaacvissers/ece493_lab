# Use Case UC-18: View accepted assigned paper in reviewer account

**Goal in Context**: After a reviewer accepts a review invitation, the assigned paper appears in the reviewer’s CMS account so the reviewer can access the manuscript and perform the review.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Reviewer (Referee)  
**Secondary Actors**: Editor; CMS Database; Authentication Service (login/session)  
**Trigger**: The reviewer accepts a review invitation (via email link or in-app), and then accesses their reviewer dashboard/assignments list.

## Success End Condition
* The accepted paper is visible in the reviewer’s account (assignments list/dashboard) and the reviewer can open the paper details/manuscript for review.

## Failed End Condition
* The accepted paper does not appear in the reviewer’s account or cannot be accessed, preventing the reviewer from completing the review.

## Preconditions
* The reviewer has a CMS account (or a reviewer identity tied to an email address) and can authenticate if required.
* The reviewer has received an invitation for a paper and the invitation is valid.
* The reviewer has accepted the invitation (assignment status is “Accepted”).
* The paper and its manuscript are available in the system.
* The reviewer has permission to access the paper after acceptance.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The reviewer accepts a review invitation for a paper (via invitation link or in-app action).
2. The system records the acceptance and updates the assignment status to **Accepted**.
3. The reviewer logs into CMS (if not already logged in).
4. The reviewer navigates to their reviewer dashboard / **My Assigned Papers** list.
5. The system retrieves the reviewer’s accepted assignments from the database.
6. The system displays the accepted paper in the reviewer’s list of assigned papers.
7. The reviewer selects the paper from the list.
8. The system displays the paper details and provides access to the manuscript so the reviewer can begin the review.

## Extensions
* **3a**: Reviewer is not authenticated (session expired or not logged in)  
    * **3a1**: The system prompts the reviewer to log in.
    * **3a2**: After login, the system returns the reviewer to the dashboard or the paper access page.
* **6a**: Accepted paper does not appear due to synchronization delay  
    * **6a1**: The system displays a message indicating assignments may take a short time to update.
    * **6a2**: The system allows the reviewer to refresh/reload the list.
    * **6a3**: The paper appears once synchronization completes.
* **6b**: Assignment not recorded as accepted (acceptance failed earlier)  
    * **6b1**: The system does not show the paper in the reviewer’s list.
    * **6b2**: The system displays a message indicating no accepted assignment exists for the paper.
    * **6b3**: The reviewer is instructed to retry acceptance or contact the editor.

    * **8a1**: The system denies access to the paper.
    * **8a2**: The system indicates the invitation must be accepted before access is granted.

    * **8b1**: The system displays an error indicating the paper is unavailable.
    * **8b2**: The system prevents access to the manuscript.
    * **8b3**: The system notifies the editor (or logs the issue) so it can be resolved.
* **5a**: Database retrieval fails when loading assignments  
    * **5a1**: The system displays an error indicating assignments cannot be loaded at this time.
    * **5a2**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
    * **5a3**: The reviewer can retry later.
