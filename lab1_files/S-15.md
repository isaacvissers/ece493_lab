# UC-15 Scenario Narratives — Notify Editor of Assignment Rule Violations

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-15: Notify editor of assignment rule violations**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

An editor is logged in to the Conference Management System (CMS) and is assigning referees to a submitted paper. The editor opens an eligible paper, selects **Assign Referees**, and enters one or more referee email addresses. The editor confirms the assignment.

Before saving the assignment, the CMS evaluates the request against assignment rules. The system checks whether each referee email is valid, whether any emails are duplicated, and whether each reviewer is below the workload limit (for example, no more than five assigned papers). During this evaluation, the CMS detects that one or more rules are violated.

The CMS immediately notifies the editor of the violations. The system displays clear messages explaining what is wrong (such as “Invalid email format,” “Reviewer already assigned,” or “Reviewer workload limit reached”) and identifies which referee entry caused each issue. The system blocks invalid assignments so no rule-breaking assignment is created.

Using the feedback, the editor corrects the problem—such as fixing an email address, removing duplicates, or selecting a different reviewer—and submits the assignment again. The CMS re-evaluates the corrected request. Once all rules pass, the system saves the assignments and displays confirmation that the referee assignments were successfully recorded.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4a: Multiple Rule Violations Occur in the Same Request

An editor attempts to assign multiple referees at once, but several problems exist simultaneously. For example, one email is invalid, another reviewer is already at the five-paper workload limit, and the same email appears twice in the list.

When the editor confirms the assignment, the CMS evaluates the request and detects multiple rule violations. Instead of reporting only the first error, the system presents a complete set of feedback, reporting all detected violations at once. Each offending entry is highlighted or listed with a clear explanation of what needs to be corrected.

The CMS blocks assignment until all blocking violations are corrected. The editor uses the full error list to address each issue efficiently and resubmits once all errors are fixed.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Notification UI Component Fails to Render

An editor submits an assignment request that violates a rule (for example, assigning a reviewer over the workload limit). The CMS detects the violation and attempts to notify the editor using the normal UI notification component (such as a banner or toast).

Due to a front-end rendering issue, the notification does not display. Even though the editor cannot see the usual message, the CMS still prevents the invalid assignment from being created. The system logs the notification rendering failure for administrators.

To avoid leaving the editor without guidance, the CMS provides alternate feedback, such as highlighting the invalid field, showing an error summary in a different area of the page, or displaying a generic “Assignment failed” status. The editor can then correct the inputs and try again.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Rules Evaluation Fails

An editor attempts to assign a referee to a paper. The CMS begins evaluating assignment rules, but a system error occurs while checking rules—for example, the database lookup for reviewer assignment counts fails, or the system cannot retrieve existing assignments.

Because the CMS cannot reliably determine whether the assignment complies with rules, it fails safely by blocking the assignment. The system notifies the editor that the assignment cannot be completed at this time due to a system issue.

The CMS logs the evaluation failure for administrator review so the underlying issue can be investigated. The editor can retry later once the system is functioning correctly.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6a: Partial Success Is Allowed (Some Valid, Some Invalid)

An editor assigns multiple referees at once. Some referee entries are valid and comply with all rules, while others violate rules (for example, one email is invalid and one reviewer is at the workload limit).

When the editor confirms the assignment, the CMS evaluates each entry individually. The system saves only the valid assignments and blocks the invalid ones. The CMS then notifies the editor with a summary: it confirms which referees were successfully assigned and identifies which entries were rejected and why.

The editor can then correct only the failing entries and resubmit without needing to repeat the valid assignments.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6b: All-or-Nothing Assignment Behavior

An editor attempts a batch assignment where at least one entry violates an assignment rule. The CMS evaluates the request and detects the violation.

Under an all-or-nothing policy, the CMS rejects the entire batch rather than saving a subset. The system saves none of the assignments and notifies the editor of every rule violation detected in the request.

With this complete information, the editor corrects the issues and resubmits the assignment batch. Once all entries comply with rules, the CMS saves the assignments successfully.
