# UC-03 Scenario Narratives — Validate Registration Password

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-03: Validate registration password**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

A user is registering for an account in the Conference Management System (CMS). While completing the registration form, the user enters a password into the password field and submits the form to proceed with registration.

When the form is submitted, the CMS begins validating the password. The system retrieves the current password security standards that define what qualifies as an acceptable password. The CMS then checks the submitted password against these standards, ensuring that it meets the minimum requirements for security and compliance.

Because the password satisfies the required security rules, the CMS confirms that the password is valid. The system allows the registration workflow to continue, enabling the user to proceed to the next step of account creation without interruption.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4a: Password is Too Short

A user attempts to register for a CMS account and enters a password into the registration form. The user submits the form expecting to continue with registration.

The CMS retrieves the password security standards and evaluates the submitted password. During validation, the system detects that the password does not meet the minimum length requirement and is therefore too short to be considered secure.

The system rejects the password and displays an error message informing the user that the password is too short. The CMS prevents the registration workflow from continuing until the user provides a longer, compliant password. The user must update the password field and resubmit the form to continue.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4b: Password Lacks Required Complexity

A user fills out the CMS registration form and provides a password that is long enough but does not satisfy complexity requirements, such as missing an uppercase letter, a number, or a symbol. The user submits the form expecting the password to be accepted.

The CMS evaluates the password against its security standards and detects that the password does not meet the required complexity rules. The password may be easy to guess or vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

The system rejects the password and displays an error message explaining that the password does not meet complexity requirements. The CMS prevents the workflow from continuing until the user updates the password to meet all required complexity rules and submits the form again.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4c: Password Contains Disallowed Content

A user enters a password into the CMS registration form and submits it. Although the password may be long enough and appear complex, it contains disallowed content such as invalid characters, forbidden patterns, or sequences that the CMS does not permit under its password security standards.

When the CMS validates the password, it detects the disallowed content and determines that the password cannot be accepted. The system rejects the password and displays an error message indicating that the password contains invalid or disallowed content.

The CMS blocks the registration process from continuing until the user replaces the password with a compliant one and resubmits the form.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Password Standards Cannot Be Retrieved

A user submits a registration form that includes a password. The CMS attempts to validate the password, but the system is unable to retrieve the current password security standards due to a configuration error, service outage, or missing policy information.

Because the CMS cannot confirm the requirements that the password must satisfy, it cannot reliably validate the password. Instead of allowing registration to continue with uncertain security validation, the system fails safely.

The CMS displays an error message indicating that password validation cannot be completed at this time. The system logs the failure for administrator review so the issue can be investigated and resolved. The user remains unable to continue the registration workflow and must try again later once the system can access the password security standards.
