# Use Case UC-32: View conference price list on the CMS webpage

**Goal in Context**: A guest or registered user views the conference price list on the CMS webpage so they know the cost before paying.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Guest User / Registered User  
**Secondary Actors**: Administrator (maintains price list); CMS Database; Web Publishing/Rendering Service (public webpage); Web Browser  
**Trigger**: The guest/registered user navigates to the **Price List** page or selects a pricing link on the CMS webpage.

## Success End Condition
* The user successfully views the current conference price list (fees and categories) in a readable format on the CMS webpage.

## Failed End Condition
* The user cannot view pricing due to missing price list, publishing/rendering failure, access restrictions, or system outage; pricing is not displayed.

## Preconditions
* The CMS has a configured price list for the conference (fees/tickets/categories) OR supports a “not available” state.
* The price list is published and available on the CMS webpage.
* If pricing visibility is restricted (policy-dependent), the user meets access requirements (guest allowed or registered required).

## Main Success Scenario
1. A guest or registered user opens the CMS webpage.
2. The user navigates to the **Price List** page (or selects a “Pricing/Fees” link).
3. The system retrieves the current conference price list (from the database or configuration).
4. The system renders the price list on the webpage in a clear, readable format (e.g., table by ticket type, early/regular rates, student/professional).
5. The user reviews the price list and understands the cost before proceeding to registration/payment.

## Extensions
* **2a**: Price list not available / not published yet  
    * **2a1**: The system displays “Price list not available yet” and does not show outdated/blank content.
* **3a**: Price list exists but contains missing/invalid entries  
    * **3a1**: The system displays available prices and clearly labels missing items as “TBD” (or hides incomplete items per policy).
    * **3a2**: The system logs the data quality issue for admin review (if supported).
* **4a**: Rendering failure or webpage error  
    * **4a1**: The system shows a friendly error message and does not expose internal error details.
    * **4a2**: The system logs the error for administrators.
* **2b**: Access restricted to registered users (policy-dependent)  
    * **2b1**: Guest user attempts to open the price list page.
    * **2b2**: The system redirects to login/registration or shows an access message.
    * **2b3**: After login (if required), the user can view the price list.
* **1a**: High traffic causes slow load  
    * **1a1**: The page remains responsive and shows a loading indicator.
    * **1a2**: If timeout occurs, the system shows a timeout message and logs performance issues.
