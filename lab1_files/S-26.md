# UC-26 Scenario Narratives — Generate Conference Schedule (Time/Rooms) for Accepted Papers

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-26: Generate conference schedule**.

---

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

An administrator logs into the Conference Management System (CMS) to organize the conference program. The administrator navigates to the **Scheduling** area, where the system displays the scheduling configuration needed to build a program, such as conference dates, time ranges, available rooms, and presentation slot duration.

The administrator verifies that the parameters are correct and clicks **Generate Schedule**. The CMS retrieves the list of papers that have been marked **Accepted** and calculates a schedule that assigns each accepted paper to an available room and time slot within the configured conference window. While generating, the system ensures that no time slot is double-booked in the same room and that each paper is placed exactly once.

After generation, the CMS saves the schedule as a **Draft** and displays it to the administrator for review. The administrator checks the time/room assignments and confirms that the schedule is acceptable. The system saves the confirmed schedule and, if configured, makes it available for publication to authors and other stakeholders.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6a: No Accepted Papers Exist

An administrator opens the scheduling tool and requests schedule generation. The CMS retrieves the accepted papers list and finds that there are no papers marked **Accepted** for the conference.

The system informs the administrator that there are no accepted papers to schedule. Depending on configuration, the CMS either generates an empty draft schedule (so the admin can still set up the program structure) or stops and returns the admin to the scheduling screen without producing a schedule.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7a: Insufficient Time Slots or Rooms to Schedule All Papers

An administrator initiates schedule generation with a set of accepted papers. The CMS calculates the total number of available slots based on the configured time window, slot duration, and room list.

During scheduling, the system determines that there are more accepted papers than available room-time slots. The CMS reports the shortfall to the administrator, such as how many papers remain unscheduled.

Depending on policy, the CMS either generates a partial draft schedule and clearly flags unscheduled papers, or blocks generation and instructs the administrator to add capacity (more rooms, longer hours, more days, shorter slots) before attempting again.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7b: Scheduling Conflict Detected

An administrator generates a schedule, but the CMS encounters a conflict during assignment—for example, a paper is placed into an already occupied room-time slot due to overlapping constraints, or a paper is accidentally assigned twice during processing.

The CMS detects the conflict and prevents a conflicting allocation from being saved as a valid final schedule. The system flags the conflict and, if supported, proposes alternative slots or highlights the affected papers and times so the administrator can adjust parameters or resolve conflicts manually. The schedule remains in a draft/incomplete state until conflicts are resolved.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4a: Required Scheduling Parameters Are Missing or Invalid

An administrator attempts to generate a schedule, but the conference scheduling configuration is incomplete—such as missing conference dates, missing time ranges, no rooms configured, or an invalid slot duration.

When the administrator clicks **Generate Schedule**, the CMS validates the inputs and detects the missing or invalid parameters. The system blocks generation and highlights the fields that must be corrected. After the administrator provides valid scheduling parameters, they can retry generation successfully.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7c: Paper Metadata Needed for Scheduling Is Missing

The administrator initiates schedule generation. The CMS retrieves accepted papers, but some papers are missing required metadata needed for placement (for example, track assignment, presentation length, or required session type).

The system flags the papers with missing metadata. If defaults are allowed, the CMS schedules those papers using default slot length/track; otherwise, the system excludes the incomplete papers from placement and generates a partial draft schedule. The administrator is informed which papers require fixes before a complete schedule can be produced.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 8a: Database Write Fails While Saving the Schedule

The administrator generates a schedule successfully, and the CMS attempts to save the draft schedule to the database. During the save operation, a database error occurs (timeout or outage).

The system displays an error indicating that the schedule could not be saved at this time and logs the failure for administrator review. The schedule is not persisted, and the administrator must retry once the system is available again.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 10a: Publication/Notification Fails After Schedule Is Saved (Optional)

The administrator generates and saves the schedule successfully. The CMS then attempts to publish the schedule and/or notify authors and stakeholders that schedule information is available.

The publication or notification service fails (for example, email service outage). Even though notifications fail, the schedule remains saved in the system in its draft or published state. The CMS logs the failure and may allow the administrator to retry publishing or resend notifications later.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 2a: Administrator Not Authorized to Schedule

A user without scheduling privileges attempts to access the scheduling area or clicks **Generate Schedule**. The CMS checks the user’s permissions and determines that they are not authorized.

The system denies access to scheduling tools and displays an authorization error. The CMS logs the access attempt for administrator review. No schedule is generated or modified.
