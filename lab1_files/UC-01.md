**Secondary Actors**: CMS Database  
**Trigger**: The public user selects the option to register a new account.

## Success End Condition

## Failed End Condition
* No account is created, and the user remains unregistered with an error message explaining the issue.

## Preconditions

## Main Success Scenario
1. The public user requests to register on the CMS system.
2. The system redirects the user to the registration webpage/form.
3. The user fills out the registration form with the required information.
4. The user submits the registration form.
5. The system validates the email and password fields.
6. The system verifies the email address is unique.
7. The system stores the new user information in the database.
