# Use Case UC-03: Validate registration password

**Goal in Context**: When a user registers (or updates their password), the system validates the provided password against defined security standards so that weak or non-compliant passwords are rejected and user accounts remain protected.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: Subfunction  
**Primary Actor**: User (Public User / Guest)  
**Secondary Actors**: CMS Database (for policy retrieval if stored there; for persistence in downstream flow)  
**Trigger**: The user submits a registration form (or password change request) containing a password.

## Success End Condition
* The system confirms the submitted password meets the required security standards and allows the registration (or password update) process to continue.

## Failed End Condition
* The system rejects the password, prevents the workflow from continuing, and displays an error message explaining that the password does not meet security standards.

## Preconditions
* The user is on a screen where a password is required (e.g., registration form).
* The user has entered a password into the password field.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The user enters a password into the password field.
2. The user submits the form/request that includes the password.
3. The system retrieves the current password security standards (if applicable).
4. The system checks the password against the security standards.
5. The system confirms the password is compliant.
6. The system allows the registration/password workflow to continue.

## Extensions
* **4a**: Password is too short (violates minimum length)  
    * **4a1**: The system displays an error message indicating the password is too short.
    * **4a2**: The system prevents the workflow from continuing until the user provides a compliant password.
* **4b**: Password lacks required complexity (e.g., missing digit/symbol/upper/lower)  
    * **4b1**: The system displays an error message indicating the password does not meet complexity requirements.
    * **4b2**: The system prevents the workflow from continuing until the user provides a compliant password.
* **4c**: Password contains disallowed content (e.g., invalid characters or forbidden patterns)  
    * **4c1**: The system displays an error message indicating the password contains invalid/disallowed content.
    * **4c2**: The system prevents the workflow from continuing until the user provides a compliant password.
* **3a**: Password standards cannot be retrieved (configuration/policy service failure)  
    * **3a1**: The system displays an error message indicating password validation cannot be completed at this time.
    * **3a2**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
    * **3a3**: The system prevents the workflow from continuing.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: High (occurs for every registration attempt that includes a password)  
* **Open Issues**:  
  * The SRS references “Password Security Standards” but does not define the exact rules (minimum length, complexity, blacklist, etc.).  
  * Whether password policy is configurable (and where it is stored) is not specified.
