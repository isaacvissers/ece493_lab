# UC-05 Scenario Narratives — Log in to CMS

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-05: Log in to CMS**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

A registered user visits the Conference Management System (CMS) and chooses to log in so they can access features that are only available to authorized users. The user selects the **Log In** option from the CMS interface.

The system responds by presenting the login form and prompting the user to enter their username and password. The user enters their credentials and submits the login request.

Once the request is submitted, the CMS checks the credentials by comparing the username and password provided by the user with the stored credentials in the CMS database. The database returns a matching record, confirming that the credentials are correct.

The system successfully authenticates the user and creates an authenticated session. The CMS then redirects the user to their home page, where they can access account-specific features such as paper submission, reviewing tasks, scheduling information, or conference registration.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Username or Password is Left Blank

A registered user attempts to log in to CMS and is shown the login form. The user begins entering credentials but accidentally leaves the username field blank, the password field blank, or both fields blank. The user submits the login request.

The CMS checks the login form submission and detects that required fields are missing. Since the system cannot authenticate a user without both a username and password, it rejects the request.

The CMS displays an error message informing the user that both fields are required. The system prevents authentication from continuing until the user provides values for both the username and password fields and resubmits the form.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Username Does Not Exist

A user opens the CMS login form and enters a username that is not registered in the system. The user also enters a password and submits the login request.

The CMS attempts to validate the login by searching the database for an account matching the submitted username. The database returns no record, meaning the username does not exist in CMS.

The system rejects the login attempt and displays an error message indicating that the credentials are invalid. The user remains unauthenticated and is not granted access to CMS features. The CMS allows the user to try again by correcting the username and resubmitting the form.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5b: Password Does Not Match Stored Password

A registered user attempts to log in and enters a valid existing username. However, the user mistypes their password or provides an incorrect password. The user submits the login request.

The CMS queries the database for the username and retrieves the stored credentials. It then compares the submitted password to the stored password and determines that they do not match.

The system rejects the login attempt and displays an error message indicating that the credentials are invalid. The user is not logged in and cannot access protected CMS features. The system remains on the login page and allows the user to attempt login again with the correct password.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5c: Database Lookup Fails

A registered user enters valid credentials into the CMS login form and submits the request. The CMS attempts to authenticate the user by querying the database for the stored credentials.

During this step, a database lookup failure occurs. This may happen due to a database connection issue, server outage, or unexpected error. Because the CMS cannot retrieve the stored credentials, it cannot confirm whether the user’s submitted credentials are correct.

The system fails safely and rejects the login attempt. It displays an error message indicating that login cannot be completed at this time. The CMS logs the failure for administrator review so the underlying issue can be investigated and resolved. The user remains unauthenticated and must retry logging in once the database becomes available again.
