# Use Case UC-06: Reject invalid login credentials

**Goal in Context**: When a registered user attempts to log in with invalid credentials, the system rejects the login attempt and displays an error message so that unauthorized access is prevented.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: Subfunction  
**Primary Actor**: Registered User (Authorized User)  
**Secondary Actors**: CMS Database  
**Trigger**: The user submits a login request with a username and password.

## Success End Condition
* The system denies access, keeps the user unauthenticated, and displays an error message indicating the credentials are invalid.

## Failed End Condition
* The system incorrectly authenticates the user or provides access to protected CMS features despite invalid credentials.

## Preconditions
* The user is on the CMS login page.
* The user is not currently logged in.
* The user submits a username and password for authentication.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The user opens the CMS login page.
2. The user enters a username and password.
3. The user submits the login request.
4. The system checks the provided username and password against the stored credentials in the database.
5. The system determines that the credentials are invalid.
6. The system rejects the login attempt.
7. The system displays an error message indicating invalid credentials.
8. The system remains on the login page and allows the user to try again.
