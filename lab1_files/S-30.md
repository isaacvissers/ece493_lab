# UC-30 Scenario Narratives — Announce Final Schedule on the CMS Webpage

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-30: Announce final schedule on the CMS webpage**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

Once the conference program is finalized, an administrator/editor publishes the final schedule for public release. The Conference Management System (CMS) stores the schedule as the official published schedule and marks it as **Publicly Visible**.

The CMS then generates or updates the public schedule webpage in HTML format. The CMS homepage (or conference landing page) displays an announcement that the final schedule is available, along with a link to the schedule page.

A public user/attendee visits the CMS webpage using a web browser. The attendee clicks the schedule announcement or navigates to the schedule section. The system loads and displays the final schedule in a clear and readable layout (such as grouped by day and time, with room assignments and session information).

The attendee reviews the schedule, identifies sessions of interest, and uses the schedule information to plan attendance at the conference.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4a: Schedule Not Yet Publicly Released

A public user/attendee visits the CMS webpage expecting to view the final schedule, but the organizers have not yet released it publicly.

When the attendee attempts to open the schedule page, the CMS detects that the schedule has not been marked as publicly visible. Instead of showing incomplete or draft data, the system either hides the schedule link or displays a message such as “Schedule not available yet.”

The attendee cannot view schedule details until the administrator/editor publishes the schedule for public release.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 2a: Public Schedule Publication Fails

An administrator/editor attempts to publish the final schedule publicly. During the publication process, the system encounters an error (such as a database failure or a publishing service outage).

The CMS displays an error message to the administrator/editor indicating that public publication failed. The system does not expose a partially generated schedule page to the public and does not update the homepage announcement incorrectly.

The CMS logs the failure for administrator review. Public users who visit the CMS webpage continue to see no schedule announcement or are shown “Schedule not available yet” until publication succeeds.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6a: Public Schedule Rendering Fails

The schedule has been published for public release, and a public user visits the schedule page. The CMS retrieves the schedule data successfully, but a rendering problem occurs (for example, an HTML template error or corrupted schedule entry data).

Instead of displaying broken HTML or technical details, the system shows a friendly public error message indicating that the schedule could not be displayed at this time. No internal error stack traces or sensitive system information is revealed.

The CMS logs the rendering failure so administrators can investigate and fix the issue. The attendee may retry later once the schedule page is restored.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Authentication Required to View the Schedule (Policy-Dependent)

A public user visits the CMS schedule page, but the conference policy requires attendees to authenticate (or register) before viewing the schedule.

When the attendee attempts to access the schedule page, the CMS detects that the user is not logged in and redirects them to the login/registration page. The user completes authentication successfully.

After login, the system returns the attendee to the schedule page they originally requested. The final schedule is then displayed normally, allowing the attendee to plan attendance.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6b: Schedule Contains Partial/Unscheduled Items

The schedule has been published publicly, but some papers or sessions do not have complete scheduling information due to late changes or organizer oversight.

When the public user loads the schedule page, the CMS renders the schedule but clearly labels incomplete entries. For example, unscheduled items may be placed in a separate section marked “Unscheduled,” or omitted entirely from the public schedule depending on conference policy.

The schedule remains readable and consistent for attendees, and the user can still plan attendance using the available information.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4b: High Traffic Causes Slow Load

After the final schedule announcement is posted, many attendees visit the CMS webpage at the same time. The schedule page experiences heavy traffic, causing the page to load slowly.

The CMS remains responsive and displays a loading indicator while the schedule is retrieved and rendered. If the system successfully completes the request, the schedule page loads normally.

If the request times out due to performance constraints, the system displays a friendly timeout message and logs the performance issue. The attendee can retry later or refresh the page once the load decreases.
