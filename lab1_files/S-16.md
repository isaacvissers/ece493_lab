# UC-16 Scenario Narratives — Receive Review Invitation by Email

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-16: Receive review invitation by email**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

An editor assigns a reviewer to a submitted paper in the Conference Management System (CMS). After the editor confirms the assignment, the CMS creates an invitation record for the reviewer and associates it with the paper. The system prepares an email invitation that includes the paper’s identification (such as title or ID), explains that the reviewer has been invited to review the paper, and provides clear instructions for responding.

The invitation email includes two response options—**Accept** and **Reject**—implemented as links or buttons that direct the reviewer to CMS. The CMS sends the invitation email using its notification service to the reviewer’s email address.

The reviewer receives the email in their inbox. After reviewing the details, the reviewer clicks either **Accept** or **Reject**. The CMS processes the reviewer’s selection, records the response in the system, and updates the assignment status accordingly. The reviewer is shown a confirmation page indicating their response has been recorded successfully, and the review process can proceed based on that decision.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4a: Email/Notification Service Fails to Send the Invitation

An editor assigns a reviewer to a paper, and the CMS generates the invitation email. When the system attempts to send the invitation through the email/notification service, the send operation fails due to an outage or configuration issue.

The CMS records that the invitation could not be sent and logs the failure for administrator review. The system warns the editor that the invitation was not delivered so the editor is aware that the reviewer has not been contacted.

The invitation remains pending in CMS so it can be retried. Once the email service is restored, the editor (or the system) can resend the invitation to the reviewer.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Invitation Is Delivered but Not Seen (Spam / Missed Email)

The CMS sends the invitation email successfully, but the reviewer does not notice it because it is filtered into a spam folder or buried in an inbox. As a result, the reviewer does not respond.

After a period of time with no response, the invitation remains pending. If the CMS supports it, the editor can resend the invitation or use an alternate contact method. This ensures that missed emails do not permanently block the review workflow.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6a: Reviewer Clicks Accept/Reject but Link Is Invalid or Expired

A reviewer receives an invitation email and clicks **Accept** or **Reject**, but the link contains an invalid token, has expired, or was already revoked. When the reviewer follows the link, the CMS cannot validate the invitation.

The system displays an error message indicating that the invitation link is invalid or expired. The CMS does not record any response and does not change the assignment status. The reviewer is instructed to contact the editor or request a new invitation link so they can respond properly.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6b: Reviewer Attempts to Respond Twice (Duplicate Response)

A reviewer receives an invitation and clicks **Accept** (or **Reject**) and the system records the response successfully. Later, the reviewer clicks the invitation link again from the same email and attempts to respond a second time, possibly choosing a different response.

The CMS checks the invitation record and detects that a response has already been recorded. To preserve the integrity of the review workflow, the system prevents the response from being changed (unless the editor explicitly reopens or reissues the invitation).

The CMS displays a message informing the reviewer that their response has already been recorded and no further action is required.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 2a: Reviewer Email Address Is Missing or Malformed

An editor attempts to assign a reviewer to a paper, but the reviewer email address is missing or incorrectly formatted. When the CMS tries to generate and send the invitation, it detects that the email address is not valid for sending.

The CMS blocks the sending step and notifies the editor that a valid reviewer email address is required. The invitation is not sent. The editor must correct the email address and retry the invitation workflow so the reviewer can receive the email and respond.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7a: Database Write Fails When Recording Reviewer Response

A reviewer receives an invitation email and clicks **Accept** or **Reject**. The CMS validates the invitation link and proceeds to record the reviewer’s response.

During the database update, an error occurs—such as a timeout or outage—preventing the system from saving the response. The CMS cannot confirm the response has been recorded.

The system displays an error indicating the response could not be recorded at this time. The CMS logs the failure for administrator review, and the assignment status remains unchanged. The reviewer may retry responding later once the system is available, or the editor may follow up if needed.
