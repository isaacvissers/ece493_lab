# Use Case UC-28: Edit and update the conference schedule

**Goal in Context**: An editor edits and updates the conference schedule so conflicts or issues can be fixed (e.g., room/time changes, unscheduled papers, corrections).  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Editor  
**Secondary Actors**: Administrator (may co-manage schedule); CMS Database; Schedule Rendering Service (HTML); Notification Service (optional)  
**Trigger**: The editor selects a schedule entry (paper/session) and chooses **Edit Schedule** (or similar).

## Success End Condition
* The editor successfully updates schedule entries (time/room assignments) and the revised schedule is saved without conflicts and is visible in schedule views (including HTML view if applicable).

## Failed End Condition
* The editor cannot save schedule changes due to validation errors, conflicts, authorization problems, concurrent edits, or system failures; the schedule remains unchanged or is saved only as a clearly labeled draft with unresolved issues (per policy).

## Preconditions
* The editor is logged into CMS.
* The editor has permission to edit the schedule for the conference (role/authorization configured).
* A schedule exists (draft or published) for the conference.
* The system supports schedule editing (modify room/time assignments, manage entries).
* The system can validate and persist schedule updates.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The editor logs into CMS.
2. The editor navigates to the conference **Scheduling** area.
3. The system displays the current schedule (draft/published) and schedule entries.
4. The editor selects a schedule entry to modify (e.g., a paper assigned to a room/time).
5. The editor chooses **Edit** and updates the assignment (e.g., new room and/or time slot).
6. The system validates the proposed change (e.g., no room-time double booking, valid slot, paper scheduled once).
7. The system saves the update to the database and updates the schedule version/state (draft or updated published schedule per policy).
8. The system displays a confirmation that the schedule was updated.
9. The updated schedule is visible to the editor in schedule views (including HTML view), reflecting the change.

## Extensions
* **6a**: Proposed change creates a conflict (e.g., room-time already occupied)  
    * **6a1**: The system blocks saving the change.
    * **6a2**: The system explains the conflict and highlights the conflicting entry.
    * **6a3**: The editor selects a different room/time or resolves the conflict and retries.
* **6b**: Proposed change moves a paper outside the conference time window  
    * **6b1**: The system blocks saving and indicates the allowed date/time range.
* **5a**: Editor attempts to remove an entry leaving the paper unscheduled (policy-dependent)  
    * **5a1**: The system allows removal but flags the paper as **Unscheduled**, or
    * **5a2**: The system blocks removal if papers must always have an assignment.
* **4a**: Schedule does not exist yet  
    * **4a1**: The system displays “No schedule available” and prompts to generate one (UC-26).
* **3a**: Editor not authorized to edit schedule  
    * **3a1**: The system denies access to editing controls and logs the attempt.
* **7a**: Database write fails while saving updates  
    * **7a1**: The system displays an error indicating the update could not be saved.
    * **7a2**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
    * **7a3**: The schedule remains unchanged.
* **6c**: Concurrent modification detected (another user edited schedule first)  
    * **6c1**: The system detects a version mismatch.
    * **6c2**: The system warns the editor and requires refresh/re-apply changes.
* **8a**: Notification/publish update fails after saving (optional)  
    * **8a1**: Schedule changes remain saved.
    * **8a2**: The system logs notification failure and may retry later.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: Medium–High  
* **Frequency**: Medium (as conflicts are discovered)
