# Use Case UC-19: Alert editor when more than three reviewers are assigned to a paper

**Goal in Context**: When reviewer assignments for a paper exceed **three**, the system alerts the editor so the reviewer count remains correct and can be corrected promptly.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: Subfunction  
**Primary Actor**: Editor (Registered User with Editor role)  
**Secondary Actors**: CMS Database; Notification/UI Messaging Component  
**Trigger**: A reviewer assignment action results in more than three reviewers assigned to a paper, or the editor views a paper whose reviewer count is already above three.

## Success End Condition
* The system detects that a paper has more than three reviewers assigned and clearly alerts the editor with the current count and guidance to correct it.

## Failed End Condition
* The system fails to detect or notify the editor of the over-assignment, allowing reviewer count to remain incorrect and potentially impacting review workflow.

## Preconditions
* The editor is logged in and has editor permissions.
* A paper exists in CMS with referee assignments recorded.
* The system has a policy/constraint that each paper should have **three** reviewers (or maximum of three).
* The system can compute the current number of assigned reviewers for a paper.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The editor opens an eligible paper and selects **Assign Referees** (or views referee assignments for the paper).
2. The editor attempts to assign a reviewer, or the system evaluates existing assignments on view.
3. The system counts the number of reviewers currently assigned to the paper.
4. The system determines that adding the reviewer (or the current state) results in **more than three** assigned reviewers.
5. The system alerts the editor that the paper has too many assigned reviewers and displays the current reviewer count.
6. The system provides guidance/actions to resolve the issue (e.g., remove/unassign a reviewer, replace an existing reviewer, or contact admin—depending on system features).
7. The editor takes corrective action (e.g., removes one reviewer or cancels the extra assignment) to bring the count back to three.
8. The system confirms the issue is resolved and the reviewer count is now correct.

## Extensions
* **4a**: Over-assignment occurs during batch assignment (multiple reviewers added at once)  
    * **4a1**: The system detects the final reviewer count exceeds three.
    * **4a2**: The system alerts the editor and identifies which addition(s) caused the count to exceed three.
    * **4a3**: The system blocks the extra assignment(s) (or flags them) according to configured policy (partial-apply or all-or-nothing).
* **5a**: Alert UI component fails to render  
    * **5a1**: The system logs the UI failure.
    * **5a2**: The system provides alternate feedback (e.g., inline error summary, field highlighting).
    * **5a3**: The system still prevents/flags over-assignment as required.
* **3a**: Reviewer count cannot be determined (DB/lookup failure)  
    * **3a1**: The system fails safely by preventing new assignment (or marking state as unknown).
    * **3a2**: The system alerts the editor that the count cannot be evaluated at this time.
    * **3a3**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
* **7a**: Editor cannot remove reviewers (unassign not supported)  
    * **7a1**: The system alerts the editor that manual correction is required via admin or alternative workflow.
    * **7a2**: The system provides instructions for resolution (e.g., contact administrator).
* **4b**: System is configured to block the 4th reviewer assignment (preventative enforcement)  
    * **4b1**: The system blocks the assignment before it is saved.
    * **4b2**: The system alerts the editor that only three reviewers are allowed.
    * **4b3**: No extra assignment record is created.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Medium (during referee assignment activities)  
* **Open Issues**:  
  * Whether the rule is “exactly three” or “at most three” is not fully specified; this use case focuses on **alerting when >3**.  
  * Whether the system blocks over-assignment or allows it but flags it is not specified.  
  * Whether editors can unassign/replace reviewers is not specified.
