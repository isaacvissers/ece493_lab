# Use Case UC-13: Assign referees to submitted papers

**Goal in Context**: An editor assigns one or more referees to a submitted paper using referee email addresses so the paper can be reviewed by appropriate reviewers.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Editor (Registered User with Editor role)  
**Secondary Actors**: CMS Database; Email/Notification Service (to notify referees, if implemented)  
**Trigger**: The editor selects a submitted paper and chooses the option to assign referees.

## Success End Condition
* Referees are successfully assigned to the selected paper (and notifications are sent if applicable), and the editor receives confirmation of the assignments.

## Failed End Condition
* Referees are not assigned (or assignments are incomplete/incorrect), and the editor receives an error message explaining why assignment could not be completed.

## Preconditions
* The editor is logged in and has editor permissions.
* At least one paper exists in the system with status **Submitted** (eligible for referee assignment).
* The editor can view the paper details/management interface.
* The referee(s) have valid email addresses to be used for assignment.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The editor navigates to the list of submitted papers.
2. The editor selects a submitted paper to manage.
3. The system displays the paper details and the **Assign Referees** option.
4. The editor selects **Assign Referees**.
5. The system prompts the editor to enter one or more referee email addresses.
6. The editor enters the referee email address(es) and confirms the assignment.
7. The system validates each email address format.
8. The system records the referee assignments for the paper in the database.
9. The system (optionally) notifies the assigned referees by email and provides them access to the paper for review.
10. The system displays confirmation that referees were assigned successfully and shows the updated referee list for the paper.

## Extensions
* **1a**: Editor is not logged in or lacks editor permissions  
    * **1a1**: The system denies access to referee assignment features.
    * **1a2**: The system redirects the user to login (if not logged in) or displays an authorization error.
* **2a**: Paper is not eligible for assignment (wrong status, withdrawn, etc.)  
    * **2a1**: The system displays a message indicating the paper cannot be assigned referees in its current state.
    * **2a2**: The system prevents assignment.
* **6a**: One or more referee email addresses are blank  
    * **6a1**: The system displays an error message indicating referee email is required.
    * **6a2**: The system prevents assignment until corrected.
* **7a**: One or more referee email addresses are invalid format  
    * **7a1**: The system displays an error message identifying invalid email(s).
    * **7a2**: The system prevents assignment until corrected.
* **7b**: Duplicate referee email address entered (same referee twice)  
    * **7b1**: The system warns the editor and removes/ignores duplicates.
    * **7b2**: The system proceeds with unique referee assignments only.
* **8a**: Referee already assigned to this paper  
    * **8a1**: The system informs the editor that the referee is already assigned.
    * **8a2**: The system does not create a duplicate assignment.
* **8b**: Database write fails while saving assignments  
    * **8b1**: The system displays an error message indicating referees could not be assigned at this time.
    * **8b2**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
    * **8b3**: The system does not partially apply assignments (all-or-nothing if possible).
* **9a**: Notification service fails (if notifications are implemented)  
    * **9a1**: The system still records the assignments successfully.
    * **9a2**: The system displays a warning that notifications could not be sent and logs the failure.
    * **9a3**: The editor can retry sending notifications later (if supported).
