# UC-17 Scenario Narratives — Ensure Each Paper Has Three Referees Assigned

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-17: Ensure each paper has exactly three referees assigned**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

A submitted paper is approaching the review stage in the Conference Management System (CMS). When the paper reaches a checkpoint where review readiness must be confirmed—such as when an editor attempts to start the review process or when the paper transitions to a “Ready for Review” status—the CMS verifies that the paper has the required number of referees assigned.

The system retrieves the current referee assignments for the paper and counts them. The CMS determines that exactly three referees are assigned. Because the referee count satisfies the policy, the CMS marks the paper as ready for review and allows the review workflow to proceed.

The system records that the readiness check passed (for audit or traceability) and, if configured, confirms that invitations for the three assigned referees have been sent so reviewers can begin the review work.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Fewer Than Three Referees Are Assigned

A paper reaches the point where the CMS must confirm that it is ready to enter the review process. The system checks the referee assignments and finds that fewer than three referees are currently assigned—perhaps only one or two reviewers have been added so far.

Because the review process requires three referees for complete coverage, the CMS blocks the paper from progressing into the review stage. The system notifies the editor that the paper is missing referee assignments and displays the current assignment count.

The CMS provides an action or link that allows the editor to assign additional referees. Once the editor assigns enough referees to reach three total, the readiness check can be performed again and the paper can proceed.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3b: More Than Three Referees Are Assigned

A paper reaches the review readiness checkpoint. The CMS checks the referee assignments and discovers that more than three referees are assigned—perhaps because additional referees were added accidentally or due to an earlier administrative mistake.

Since the policy requires exactly three referees per paper, the CMS flags the policy violation. The system blocks progression to the review stage (or marks the paper as needing correction) and notifies the editor that too many referees are assigned, showing the current count.

The CMS provides a way for the editor to resolve the issue—such as unassigning a referee if that functionality exists, or escalating to an administrator. Once the referee count is reduced to three, the paper can proceed into the review workflow.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 2a: Assignment Count Cannot Be Determined

A paper reaches the review readiness checkpoint and the CMS attempts to check how many referees are assigned. During the lookup, a system issue occurs—for example, the database cannot be reached or the assignment records cannot be retrieved due to an error.

Because the CMS cannot reliably determine whether the paper satisfies the referee assignment policy, it fails safely by blocking progression to the review stage. The system informs the editor that review readiness cannot be evaluated at this time and that the operation should be retried later.

The CMS logs the failure for administrator review so the issue can be investigated. Once the underlying system problem is resolved, the readiness check can be performed again.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Invitations Not Sent to All Three Referees

A paper reaches the review readiness checkpoint and the CMS confirms that three referees are assigned. The system then attempts to ensure that invitation emails have been sent to all three referees.

During this process, the notification service fails for one or more referees. The CMS still recognizes that the correct number of referees are assigned, but it flags that invitations were not successfully issued to everyone.

The system notifies the editor that one or more invitations could not be sent and logs the failure. If supported, the CMS allows the editor to resend invitations so all three referees receive the invitation and can respond.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3c: Editor Attempts to Assign a Fourth Referee

An editor attempts to assign an additional referee to a paper that already has three referees assigned. When the editor enters the new referee information and confirms, the CMS checks the current referee count for the paper.

The system detects that adding another referee would increase the count beyond the policy limit of three. To enforce the policy, the CMS blocks the assignment and notifies the editor that only three referees are allowed for the paper under this rule.

If replacement is supported, the CMS suggests that the editor replace an existing referee rather than adding a fourth. Otherwise, the editor must decide which referee assignment to remove before adding a new one.
