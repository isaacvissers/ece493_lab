# Use Case UC-26: Generate conference schedule (time/rooms) for accepted papers

**Goal in Context**: An administrator generates a conference schedule that assigns **time slots** and **rooms** for accepted papers so the event can be organized and published.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Administrator  
**Secondary Actors**: Editor (source of accepted papers); Authors/Speakers (consumers of schedule); CMS Database; Notification Service (optional)  
**Trigger**: The administrator selects **Generate Schedule** for a conference after paper decisions are finalized.

## Success End Condition
* A complete schedule is generated and stored, mapping each accepted paper to a room and time slot (and session, if applicable), and the schedule is available for admin review and publication.

## Failed End Condition
* The system cannot generate a valid schedule (due to missing inputs, insufficient time/rooms, conflicts, or system errors), and no schedule (or only a clearly marked draft) is produced.

## Preconditions
* The administrator is logged into CMS.
* The administrator has permission to manage conference scheduling.
* Accepted papers exist (papers with status **Accepted**) or the admin intentionally generates an empty schedule.
* Conference scheduling inputs are available/configured:
  * conference dates and time ranges,
  * available rooms,
  * slot duration/session structure (if required),
  * any scheduling constraints (if supported).
* The system can store and display the resulting schedule.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The administrator logs into CMS.
2. The administrator navigates to the conference **Scheduling** area.
3. The system displays scheduling configuration inputs (dates/times, rooms, slot duration, constraints).
4. The administrator confirms or enters required scheduling parameters.
5. The administrator selects **Generate Schedule**.
6. The system retrieves the list of **accepted** papers for the conference.
7. The system computes a schedule by assigning each accepted paper to an available room and time slot, respecting configured constraints.
8. The system stores the generated schedule as a **Draft** schedule.
9. The system displays the draft schedule to the administrator for review (time/room per paper).
10. The administrator confirms the schedule is acceptable and saves it (and optionally publishes it for authors/attendees).

## Extensions
* **6a**: No accepted papers exist  
    * **6a1**: The system informs the administrator there are no accepted papers to schedule.
    * **6a2**: The system generates an empty draft schedule (if allowed) or stops without generating.
* **7a**: Insufficient time slots / rooms to schedule all accepted papers  
    * **7a1**: The system detects that not all papers can be placed.
    * **7a2**: The system reports capacity shortfall (e.g., number of papers vs available slots).
    * **7a3**: The system either (a) generates a partial draft with unscheduled papers flagged, or (b) blocks generation until capacity is increased.
* **7b**: Scheduling conflict detected (overlapping assignments, duplicate placement)  
    * **7b1**: The system prevents conflicting allocations.
    * **7b2**: The system flags the conflict and proposes alternatives (if supported) or requests admin adjustment.
* **4a**: Required scheduling parameters are missing/invalid  
    * **4a1**: The system blocks generation and highlights missing/invalid inputs (e.g., no rooms configured).
    * **4a2**: The administrator corrects inputs and retries.
* **7c**: Paper metadata needed for scheduling is missing (e.g., track/session length)  
    * **7c1**: The system flags papers with missing metadata.
    * **7c2**: The system schedules using defaults (if allowed) or excludes those papers from placement.
* **8a**: Database write fails while saving generated schedule  
    * **8a1**: The system displays an error indicating the schedule could not be saved.
    * **8a2**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
    * **8a3**: The schedule is not persisted; the administrator can retry.
* **10a**: Publication/notification fails after schedule is saved (optional)  
    * **10a1**: The schedule remains saved as draft/published state as appropriate.
    * **10a2**: The system logs the failure and may allow retry publishing/notifications.
* **2a**: Administrator not authorized to schedule  
    * **2a1**: The system denies access to scheduling tools and logs the attempt.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: Medium–High (required before conference)  
* **Frequency**: Low–Medium (typically once per conference, with revisions)  
* **Open Issues**:  
  * The exact scheduling algorithm (auto-assign, constraints, tracks, session chairs) is not specified.  
  * Whether schedule generation is fully automatic or requires manual adjustments is not specified (assumed: auto draft + admin review).  
  * Whether schedule publication to attendees is in scope is not specified.
