# UC-08 Scenario Narratives — Submit Paper Manuscript

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-08: Submit paper manuscript**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

A registered author is logged in to the Conference Management System (CMS) and wants to submit a paper so it can be reviewed for the conference. From their home page, the author selects **Submit Paper** to start a new manuscript submission.

The CMS redirects the author to the manuscript submission page and presents a submission form. The author fills in the required metadata for the manuscript—such as the names of the authors, affiliations and contact information, the abstract, keywords, and the main source information. The author then uploads the manuscript file in an accepted format (PDF, Word, or LaTeX) and ensures the file is within the size limit.

When the author submits the form, the CMS validates the input. First, it checks that all required fields are present and properly formatted. Next, it verifies that the uploaded file is of an allowed type and does not exceed 7MB.

Because the submission is valid, the CMS stores the manuscript metadata and uploaded file in the system’s database/storage. The system displays a success message confirming the manuscript was recorded and redirects the author back to their home page. The manuscript is now available in the system for later steps in the review process (such as referee assignment).

## Alternative Path Narrative — 1a: Author Is Not Logged In

An author attempts to submit a paper by clicking **Submit Paper**, but the author is not currently logged in (for example, their session has expired). The CMS detects that the submission feature requires authentication.

Instead of showing the submission form, the system redirects the author to the login page and asks them to authenticate. After the author logs in successfully, the CMS returns the author to the manuscript submission page so they can continue starting their submission without having to navigate again.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Author Saves a Draft Instead of Submitting

An author begins completing the manuscript submission form but is not ready to finalize the submission. The author may still be refining the abstract, gathering co-author details, or preparing the final manuscript file. To avoid losing progress, the author clicks **Save** instead of submitting.

The CMS validates the information the author has already entered and checks the uploaded file if one has been attached. If the current information is acceptable for saving, the system stores the submission state as a draft. The CMS shows a confirmation message indicating that the draft was saved successfully. The author can return later to continue editing the draft and submit it when ready.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Required Fields Are Missing

An author opens the submission form, fills in some information, and uploads a file, but accidentally leaves one or more required fields blank (such as missing an abstract or missing required author contact information). The author submits the form expecting the manuscript to be recorded.

The CMS validates the form and detects missing required fields. Since incomplete submissions should not proceed into the review process, the system rejects the submission attempt. The CMS displays an error message identifying which required fields are missing and prevents the manuscript from being submitted until the author completes the required information and resubmits.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5b: Invalid Field Content

An author completes the submission form but enters invalid information in one or more fields—for example, an incorrectly formatted email address for an author contact, or disallowed characters in a text field. The author submits the form.

The CMS validates the submission and detects invalid field content. The system rejects the submission and shows an error message indicating which fields are invalid and what must be corrected. The manuscript is not submitted until the author fixes the invalid content and submits again.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6a: Uploaded File Type Is Not Accepted

An author completes the submission form and uploads a manuscript file, but the file format is not accepted (for example, an image file or a `.txt` file). The author submits the form expecting CMS to accept the upload.

The CMS checks the uploaded file and determines it is not in one of the allowed formats (PDF, Word, or LaTeX). The system rejects the submission attempt and displays an error message explaining the accepted file types. The author must replace the file with a valid format before the manuscript can be submitted.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6b: Uploaded File Exceeds Maximum Size (7MB)

An author uploads a manuscript file that is in an accepted format, but the file is larger than the system’s maximum size limit of 7MB. The author submits the form.

The CMS validates the submission and checks the file size. It detects the file is too large and rejects the submission. The system displays an error message explaining that the file exceeds the maximum size and that a smaller file must be uploaded. The manuscript is not submitted until the author uploads a compliant file.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6c: File Upload Fails

An author fills out the submission form and attempts to upload their manuscript file. During the upload, a network interruption or server-side issue occurs and the upload does not complete successfully.

The CMS detects the upload failure and informs the author that the file upload failed. The system does not proceed with final submission because the manuscript file is required. The author is given the opportunity to retry the upload (for example, by selecting the file again and reattempting). Once the upload succeeds, the author can resubmit the form.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7a: Database/Storage Write Fails While Saving the Submission

An author submits a valid manuscript submission with all required fields completed and a compliant manuscript file uploaded. The CMS validates the submission successfully and proceeds to store the manuscript metadata and file.

During the save step, an unexpected database or storage failure occurs (such as a database outage, storage service failure, or timeout). The CMS cannot record the submission.

The system displays an error message indicating that the manuscript could not be recorded at this time. The CMS logs the failure for administrator review. The manuscript is not marked as submitted, and the author must retry later once the system is functioning normally.
