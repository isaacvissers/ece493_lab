# UC-23 Scenario Narratives — Send Completed Reviews to the Editor

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-23: Send completed reviews to the editor**.

---

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

A reviewer completes a review for an assigned paper and clicks **Submit Review** in the Conference Management System (CMS). The CMS validates the review and successfully stores it in the database with a status of **Submitted**.

The system detects that a new submitted review is now available for editor use. The CMS associates the review with the correct paper and the editor responsible for that paper. The editor’s in-app view (for example, the paper’s review list) is updated so that the newly submitted review is visible and accessible.

If the system is configured to notify editors, the CMS generates a notification indicating that a new review has been submitted for the paper. The system sends the notification through the configured channel (such as email or an in-app alert).

The editor logs into CMS, opens the paper, and sees the newly submitted review in the reviews section. The system optionally records a delivery/notification event for traceability.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 2a: Review Submission Fails (No Delivery Attempt)

A reviewer attempts to submit a review, but the submission fails due to validation errors or a persistence problem. The CMS does not mark the review as submitted, and therefore it does not initiate delivery or notification to the editor.

The reviewer is shown an error message describing what went wrong and is given the opportunity to correct the review or retry later. Because the review never reaches a submitted state, the editor does not see a new review and receives no notification.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Notification Service Fails but Review Is Still Available In-App

A reviewer submits a review successfully and the CMS stores it as **Submitted**. The system updates the editor’s in-app review list so the review is available for viewing.

After storing the review, the CMS attempts to notify the editor using the notification service (for example, email). The notification service fails due to an outage or configuration issue.

Even though the notification cannot be sent, the review remains stored and accessible to the editor within CMS. The system logs the notification failure for administrator review and may retry later or provide a manual resend option if supported.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4a: Editor Cannot Be Determined

A reviewer submits a review successfully and the CMS stores it as **Submitted**. When the system attempts to deliver the review to the editor’s view, it cannot determine which editor is responsible for the paper due to missing configuration or assignment.

The CMS preserves the submitted review and flags the paper/review as needing administrative attention. The system logs the issue and may notify an administrator or default role for resolution.

Until the configuration is corrected, the review may not appear in any specific editor’s list, delaying decision-making.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7a: Editor Lacks Permission to View the Review

A reviewer submits a review and the CMS stores it successfully. The system attempts to make the review available to the editor. However, due to an authorization misconfiguration, the editor account does not have permission to access the review.

When the editor tries to open the reviews section, the CMS denies access and displays an authorization error. The system logs the configuration issue and instructs the editor to contact an administrator. The review remains stored but cannot be viewed by the editor until permissions are corrected.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Duplicate Delivery Attempt

A reviewer submits a review, and the system delivers it successfully to the editor’s in-app view and possibly sends a notification. Due to a retry mechanism, a delayed event, or repeated processing, the system attempts to deliver/notify the same review again.

The CMS detects that the review has already been delivered/notified and suppresses duplicate notifications. The review remains as a single record in the editor’s view, preventing confusion and alert spam.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6a: Batch Delivery When Multiple Reviews Arrive Close Together

Multiple reviewers submit reviews for the same paper within a short period. Each submission is stored as **Submitted**, and the system processes delivery for each new review.

The CMS updates the editor’s in-app review list so that all newly submitted reviews are visible. If notifications are enabled, the system either sends separate notifications per review or groups them into a single combined notification, depending on configuration.

The editor logs in and finds that all newly submitted reviews are available for the paper.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 8a: Audit/Logging Fails After Delivery

A reviewer submits a review successfully, and the system delivers it to the editor’s in-app view. The editor can access the review normally.

After delivery, the system attempts to write an audit/log entry to record the delivery/notification event. The logging operation fails due to a system issue.

The CMS treats delivery as successful and does not remove editor access. The system records the logging failure to system logs/monitoring for administrators to investigate.
