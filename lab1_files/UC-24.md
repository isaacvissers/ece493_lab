# Use Case UC-24: Make final accept/reject decision after 3 reviews are complete

**Goal in Context**: An editor makes a final accept/reject decision for a paper once three reviews are complete so the paper can proceed to scheduling (if accepted) or be rejected.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Editor  
**Secondary Actors**: Reviewer (source of reviews); Author (recipient of outcome); CMS Database; Notification Service (optional)  
**Trigger**: The editor selects a submitted paper with three completed reviews and chooses **Make Decision** (Accept/Reject).

## Success End Condition
* The editor records a final decision (**Accepted** or **Rejected**) for the paper, the decision is stored in CMS, and the paper status is updated accordingly for the next conference workflow step.

## Failed End Condition
* The editor cannot record a decision (due to missing reviews, validation errors, permission issues, or system failures), and the paper remains undecided.

## Preconditions
* The editor is logged into CMS.
* The editor has permission to manage the paper and record decisions.
* The paper exists in the system and is in a state eligible for decision-making.
* Exactly **three** reviews have been submitted and are available for the paper (review status = Submitted/Complete).
* The decision period is open (if the system enforces deadlines/periods for decisions).

## Main Success Scenario
1. The editor logs into CMS.
2. The editor navigates to the list of submitted papers (e.g., **Papers to Decide**).
3. The system displays papers that have three completed reviews and are eligible for a final decision.
4. The editor selects a paper to review.
5. The system displays the paper details and the three submitted reviews.
6. The editor selects **Make Decision**.
7. The editor chooses a final decision (**Accept** or **Reject**) and optionally enters decision comments.
8. The system validates that three reviews are complete and that the editor is authorized to decide.
9. The system stores the decision in the database and updates the paper status to **Accepted** or **Rejected**.
10. The system confirms to the editor that the decision was saved successfully.
11. (Optional) The system notifies the author(s) of the decision and/or updates the next workflow stage (e.g., scheduling queue for accepted papers).

## Extensions
* **3a**: Paper does not yet have three completed reviews  
    * **3a1**: The system prevents decision entry.
    * **3a2**: The system informs the editor that a final decision requires three completed reviews.
    * **3a3**: The system shows the current number/status of reviews.
* **3b**: More than three reviews exist for the paper  
    * **3b1**: The system alerts the editor of the inconsistency.
    * **3b2**: The system blocks decision entry until the review count is corrected (or selects the correct three per policy).
* **8a**: Editor is not authorized to decide for this paper  
    * **8a1**: The system denies access to decision entry.
    * **8a2**: The system displays an authorization error and logs the issue.
* **9a**: Database write fails while saving the decision  
    * **9a1**: The system displays an error indicating the decision could not be saved.
    * **9a2**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
    * **9a3**: The paper status remains unchanged (no partial update).
* **7a**: Editor attempts to submit without selecting Accept/Reject  
    * **7a1**: The system blocks saving.
    * **7a2**: The system prompts the editor to choose a decision value.
* **11a**: Notification sending fails after decision is saved (optional)  
    * **11a1**: The decision remains stored and paper status updated.
    * **11a2**: The system logs notification failure and may retry later.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Medium (per paper, after reviews complete)  
* **Open Issues**:  
  * Whether editors can revise a decision after saving is not specified.  
  * Whether “exactly 3” vs “at least 3” reviews are required is assumed to be exactly 3 based on the user story.  
  * Whether decision comments are required is not specified.
