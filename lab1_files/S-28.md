# UC-28 Scenario Narratives — Edit and Update the Conference Schedule

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-28: Edit and update the schedule**.

---

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

An editor logs into the Conference Management System (CMS) and navigates to the **Scheduling** area to correct issues in the conference schedule. The system shows the current schedule in a reviewable format. The editor identifies a schedule entry that needs adjustment, such as a paper assigned to the wrong room or a time slot conflict that needs resolution.

The editor selects the schedule entry and chooses **Edit**. The editor updates the assignment—changing the room, the time slot, or both. Before saving, the CMS validates that the new assignment is valid, does not overlap with another paper in the same room, and keeps the paper within the conference’s allowed schedule window.

Since the updated assignment is valid, the CMS saves the change to the database and updates the current schedule. The system confirms the update to the editor. When the editor refreshes or reopens the schedule views (including the HTML schedule view if available), the new time/room assignment is reflected, showing the conflict has been resolved.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6a: Proposed Change Creates a Conflict (Room-Time Already Occupied)

The editor attempts to move a paper to a new room and time slot. When the editor submits the change, the CMS checks availability and detects that the selected room-time slot is already assigned to another paper.

The system blocks the save action and displays an error explaining the conflict and identifying the conflicting entry. The editor chooses a different time slot or room, or resolves the conflict by moving the other entry first. Once the conflict is removed, the editor retries and the system saves the updated schedule successfully.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6b: Proposed Change Moves a Paper Outside the Conference Time Window

The editor edits a schedule entry and selects a time slot that is outside the configured conference window (for example, outside conference dates or outside permitted hours).

When the editor attempts to save, the CMS validates the date/time range and detects the assignment is not allowed. The system blocks saving and informs the editor of the permitted conference time window. The editor selects a valid slot and retries, after which the update is saved successfully.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Removing an Entry Leaves a Paper Unscheduled (Policy-Dependent)

The editor identifies a schedule entry that should be removed (for example, to reassign later). The editor selects the entry and attempts to remove it.

Depending on system policy, the CMS either allows the removal and marks the paper as **Unscheduled** (so the editor can reassign it later), or blocks removal if every accepted paper must always be scheduled. In the allowed case, the system clearly flags the paper as unscheduled in schedule views. In the blocked case, the system informs the editor that removal is not permitted unless a new assignment is provided.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4a: Schedule Does Not Exist Yet

An editor navigates to the scheduling area expecting to edit the schedule, but no schedule has been generated for the conference.

The CMS displays a clear “No schedule available” message and does not show editing controls. The system prompts the editor to generate a schedule first (UC-26) or contact an administrator. The editor cannot proceed with editing until a schedule exists.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Editor Not Authorized to Edit the Schedule

A user acting as an editor attempts to access schedule editing tools. The CMS checks permissions and determines that the user does not have rights to modify the schedule.

The system hides or disables editing controls and shows an authorization error if an edit attempt is made. The CMS logs the unauthorized attempt for administrator review. No schedule changes occur.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7a: Database Write Fails While Saving Updates

An editor makes a valid schedule change and clicks save. The CMS completes validation and attempts to persist the update.

During the save operation, a database error occurs, preventing the change from being stored. The system displays an error indicating the update could not be saved and logs the failure for administrator review. The schedule remains unchanged, and the editor can retry later once the system is functioning.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6c: Concurrent Modification Detected

An editor opens the schedule and begins editing a schedule entry. While the editor is working, another authorized user changes the schedule and saves their updates.

When the first editor attempts to save their changes, the CMS detects a version mismatch (the schedule has been modified since it was loaded). The system warns the editor that the schedule has changed and requires the editor to refresh the schedule. The editor reloads the latest schedule and re-applies the desired update on top of the most recent version before saving successfully.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 8a: Notification/Publish Update Fails After Saving (Optional)

An editor saves a schedule change successfully, and the updated schedule is stored. The system then attempts to publish the change or notify authors/attendees that the schedule has been updated.

The notification or publishing operation fails due to an external service outage. The schedule changes remain saved and visible in CMS, but notifications are not delivered. The system logs the failure and may allow the editor/admin to retry notifications later.
