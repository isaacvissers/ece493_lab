# UC-10 Scenario Narratives — Enter Manuscript Metadata

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-10: Enter manuscript metadata**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

An author is preparing a paper submission in the Conference Management System (CMS). After opening the manuscript submission form, the author sees fields that describe the paper and its contributors. The CMS presents metadata fields such as author names, affiliations, contact information, abstract, keywords, and main source.

The author carefully enters the names of all contributing authors and provides their affiliations. The author enters valid contact information so the conference organizers can reach the submission’s primary contact. The author writes or pastes the abstract that summarizes the paper’s content, adds relevant keywords that help categorize the paper, and selects or enters the main source information required by the submission form.

Once the metadata is complete, the author saves the information or submits the form. The CMS validates that all required fields are filled in and checks that key fields follow expected formats, such as verifying that the contact email is properly formatted. Since the metadata is complete and valid, the CMS stores the manuscript metadata in the database linked to the submission.

The system confirms that the metadata was saved successfully, and the submission now contains a complete description of the paper for later steps such as reviewer assignment and decision making.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Author Saves Partially Completed Metadata as a Draft

An author begins filling out the manuscript metadata fields but is not ready to complete the submission. For example, the author may still be confirming co-author details, refining the abstract, or deciding on the best keywords.

Instead of submitting the metadata, the author selects **Save Draft**. The CMS stores the currently entered metadata values as part of a draft submission, even though some fields may still be incomplete. The system confirms that the draft has been saved successfully.

The author can return later to reopen the draft and continue entering the remaining required metadata before submitting the manuscript.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Required Metadata Fields Are Missing

An author opens the submission form and enters some metadata, but accidentally leaves one or more required fields blank. For example, the author might omit the abstract, leave the keywords field empty, or fail to provide contact information.

When the author attempts to submit or save the metadata, the CMS validates the required fields and detects that the metadata is incomplete. Since the paper cannot be properly described without the missing information, the system rejects the request.

The CMS displays an error message identifying which required fields are missing and prevents the author from finalizing the submission until the missing metadata is completed. The author must fill in the missing fields and try again.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6a: Contact Information Is Invalid

An author completes the metadata fields but enters invalid contact information, such as an incorrectly formatted email address. The author submits or saves the form expecting the metadata to be accepted.

The CMS validates the metadata and detects that the contact information does not meet the required format. Because valid contact information is necessary for communication about the submission, the system rejects the request.

The CMS displays an error message indicating that the contact information is invalid and prevents saving/submission until the author corrects the contact details. Once the author fixes the contact information and resubmits, the system can continue normally.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6b: Keywords Field Is Invalid

An author fills out the metadata form but provides invalid keywords. This could occur if the author leaves the keyword list empty, enters too many keywords, or uses an invalid format that CMS does not accept.

When the author submits or saves the form, the CMS validates the keyword field and determines that it does not meet system requirements. The system rejects the request to ensure submissions remain consistent and searchable.

The CMS displays an error message explaining that the keywords are invalid and prevents saving/submission until the author corrects the keyword field. After correction, the author can resubmit the metadata successfully.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7a: Database Write Fails While Saving Metadata

An author completes all manuscript metadata correctly and attempts to save or submit it. The CMS validates the fields successfully and then attempts to store the metadata in the database linked to the submission.

During the save step, an unexpected database failure occurs, such as a connection issue or timeout. The CMS cannot store the metadata.

The system displays an error message indicating that the metadata could not be saved at this time. The CMS logs the failure for administrator review. The metadata changes are not committed, and the author must retry once the system becomes available again.
