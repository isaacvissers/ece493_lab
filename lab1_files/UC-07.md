# Use Case UC-07: Change password

**Goal in Context**: A registered user changes their account password so they can maintain account security and keep their credentials up to date.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Registered User (Authorized User)  
**Secondary Actors**: CMS Database  
**Trigger**: The user selects the option to change their password.

## Success End Condition
* The user’s password is updated successfully in the CMS database, and the user receives confirmation that the change was completed.

## Failed End Condition
* The user’s password is not changed, and the user receives an error message explaining why the change could not be completed.

## Preconditions
* The user is logged in (authenticated session exists).
* The user can access the account/security settings page.
* The password security standards are available for validating the new password.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The user navigates to account/security settings.
2. The user selects the **Change Password** option.
3. The system prompts the user to enter their current password and a new password (and confirmation, if required).
4. The user enters their current password and a new compliant password.
5. The user submits the password change request.
6. The system verifies the current password matches the stored password for the user.
7. The system validates the new password against password security standards.
8. The system updates the user’s password in the database.
9. The system displays a success message confirming the password was changed.
