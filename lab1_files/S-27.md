# UC-27 Scenario Narratives — View Conference Schedule in HTML Format

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-27: View schedule in HTML format**.

---

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

An administrator/editor logs into the Conference Management System (CMS) to review the conference schedule. The user navigates to the **Scheduling** area and selects **View Schedule (HTML)**.

The CMS retrieves the latest schedule (draft or published, based on configuration) from the database. The system then renders the schedule into an HTML page that organizes papers by time and room (or another readable layout such as an agenda list).

The HTML schedule page loads in the user’s browser and clearly shows each accepted paper’s assigned time slot and room. The administrator/editor reviews the schedule for correctness, readability, and completeness. If desired, the user uses standard browser features such as printing the page or saving it as a PDF for sharing and review.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4a: No Schedule Exists Yet

A user navigates to the scheduling area and selects **View Schedule (HTML)** before any schedule has been generated.

The CMS checks for schedule data and finds none. Rather than showing an empty or broken page, the system displays a clear message such as “No schedule available yet.” The page may include a helpful prompt or link to generate a schedule.

The user returns to the scheduling workflow to generate or import a schedule before trying to view it again.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: User Not Authorized to View Schedule

A user without schedule viewing permissions attempts to open the HTML schedule page. The user clicks **View Schedule (HTML)**, but the CMS verifies role permissions and determines the user is not authorized.

The system denies access and shows an authorization error message. The CMS logs the unauthorized attempt for administrative review. No schedule content is displayed to the unauthorized user.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Rendering Fails Due to Template or Data Error

An authorized administrator/editor requests the HTML schedule view. The CMS successfully retrieves schedule data but encounters an error while rendering the HTML—such as a template failure, corrupted data, or a rendering service outage.

Instead of showing a partially rendered page, the system displays an error indicating the schedule could not be rendered at this time. The CMS logs the rendering failure for administrators to investigate.

The user may retry later after the issue is resolved or request support if the error persists.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4b: Schedule Contains Missing/Invalid Entries (Partial Draft)

An administrator generates a draft schedule that includes unscheduled papers (for example, due to insufficient capacity). The administrator then selects **View Schedule (HTML)** to review the draft.

The CMS retrieves the schedule and renders it into HTML. For items that are missing assignments, the system clearly labels them—such as placing them into an “Unscheduled” section or marking them with “Unscheduled” next to the paper title.

The schedule remains readable and the page does not crash. The administrator can identify which papers still need room/time assignments and return to scheduling adjustments.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6a: Large Schedule Takes Too Long to Load

An administrator/editor requests the HTML schedule view for a large conference program with many accepted papers. Rendering and loading takes longer than usual.

The system displays a loading indicator while the schedule is being prepared. If the system completes rendering within acceptable time, the HTML schedule page loads normally.

If the operation times out due to performance constraints, the CMS displays a timeout or performance error message and logs the issue for administrators to optimize. The user can retry later or use alternative schedule views if available.
