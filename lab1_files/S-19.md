# UC-19 Scenario Narratives — Alert Editor When More Than Three Reviewers Are Assigned

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-19: Alert editor when more than three reviewers are assigned to a paper**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

An editor is managing reviewer assignments for a paper in the Conference Management System (CMS). The editor opens the paper and either views the current referee list or selects **Assign Referees** to add another reviewer.

The CMS counts the number of reviewers currently assigned to the paper. The system determines that adding another reviewer (or the paper’s existing state) results in more than three assigned reviewers. Because the reviewer count must remain correct, the system immediately alerts the editor that the paper has too many reviewers assigned and displays the current count.

The CMS provides guidance on how to correct the issue, such as removing an extra reviewer or replacing an existing reviewer instead of adding a fourth. The editor takes corrective action to bring the assigned reviewer count back down to three. Once corrected, the CMS confirms that the issue is resolved and the paper now has the correct reviewer count.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4a: Over-Assignment Occurs During Batch Assignment

An editor attempts to assign multiple reviewers at once by entering several referee email addresses. The paper already has two reviewers assigned, and adding the entered set would push the total above three.

When the editor confirms the batch assignment, the CMS counts the current reviewers and evaluates the final count after applying the requested assignments. The system detects that the final reviewer count would exceed three.

The CMS alerts the editor and clearly indicates that the reviewer count would become too high. The system identifies which addition(s) caused the over-assignment. Depending on system policy, it either blocks only the extra assignments (partial apply) or blocks the entire batch (all-or-nothing). The editor then adjusts the list to ensure the paper has no more than three reviewers.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Alert UI Component Fails to Render

An editor triggers an over-assignment scenario (for example, attempting to add a fourth reviewer). The CMS detects that the reviewer count exceeds three and attempts to display an alert to the editor.

Due to a UI rendering issue (e.g., notification banner failure), the alert does not appear as expected. Even though the normal alert is missing, the CMS still prevents or flags the over-assignment according to its enforcement rules.

The system logs the UI failure for administrators and provides alternate feedback, such as highlighting the problematic assignment entry, showing an error summary panel, or displaying a generic “Assignment cannot be completed” status. The editor can still correct the over-assignment and proceed.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Reviewer Count Cannot Be Determined

An editor attempts to assign reviewers, and the CMS starts to count how many reviewers are currently assigned to the paper. During this step, a database issue occurs and the system cannot retrieve the assignment list.

Because the CMS cannot determine whether the reviewer count would exceed three, it fails safely. The system prevents the assignment from proceeding (or marks the state as unknown) and alerts the editor that the reviewer count cannot be evaluated at this time.

The CMS logs the failure for administrator review. The editor must retry later when the system can reliably retrieve assignment data.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7a: Editor Cannot Remove Reviewers (Unassign Not Supported)

An editor is alerted that more than three reviewers are assigned to a paper. The editor attempts to correct the problem by removing an extra reviewer, but the CMS does not support unassigning reviewers directly.

The system still alerts the editor to the policy violation, but instead of offering a remove action, it provides instructions for correction. For example, it may instruct the editor to contact an administrator or use an alternate workflow to adjust reviewer assignments.

Until the reviewer count is corrected through the appropriate channel, the paper remains flagged as having an incorrect reviewer count.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4b: System Blocks the Fourth Reviewer Assignment (Preventative Enforcement)

An editor attempts to add a fourth reviewer to a paper that already has three reviewers assigned. Before saving the new assignment, the CMS checks the current reviewer count and determines that the addition would exceed the maximum allowed.

Rather than allowing the assignment and then flagging it, the system blocks the assignment immediately. The CMS alerts the editor that only three reviewers are allowed for a paper under this policy.

No extra assignment record is created, and the editor must either replace an existing reviewer (if supported) or choose not to add the fourth reviewer.
