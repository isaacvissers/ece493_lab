# Use Case UC-23: Send completed reviews to the editor

**Goal in Context**: The system sends (delivers) completed reviews to the editor once reviewers complete them so the editor can make informed acceptance/rejection decisions.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: Subfunction (System Notification/Delivery)  
**Primary Actor**: System (CMS)  
**Secondary Actors**: Editor; Reviewer; CMS Database; Notification Service (Email/In-app)  
**Trigger**: A reviewer submits a review for a paper (review status becomes **Submitted**) or a review transitions into a “Completed” state.

## Success End Condition
* The editor is able to access the newly completed review in CMS (and, if configured, receives a notification) after a reviewer submits it.

## Failed End Condition
* The review is submitted but not delivered/visible to the editor and/or notifications are not sent, delaying or preventing editor decision-making.

## Preconditions
* A paper exists with an editor assigned (or an identifiable editor role for the paper/conference).
* A reviewer is authorized for the paper and submits a review (UC-21).
* The submitted review is stored successfully in the database.
* The system has a delivery mechanism to expose reviews to editors (in-app review list) and optionally notify them (email/in-app alerts).
* The editor has permission to view reviews for papers they manage.

## Main Success Scenario
1. A reviewer submits a completed review for a paper.
2. The system validates and stores the review as **Submitted**.
3. The system detects that a new submitted review is available for editor consumption.
4. The system associates the review with the paper’s editor (or editor role) and updates the editor’s in-app view (e.g., paper review list) to include the new review.
5. (Optional) The system generates a notification to the editor indicating a review has been submitted for the paper.
6. The system sends the notification via the configured channel(s) (e.g., email and/or in-app).
7. The editor opens CMS and views the paper’s reviews, including the newly submitted review.
8. The system logs the delivery/notification event (audit/traceability), if supported.

## Extensions
* **2a**: Review submission fails (validation or persistence failure)  
    * **2a1**: The review is not marked as submitted.
    * **2a2**: The system does not attempt delivery/notification.
    * **2a3**: The reviewer is informed and can retry submission.
* **5a**: Notification service fails (email/in-app notification cannot be sent)  
    * **5a1**: The review remains stored as **Submitted** and available to the editor in-app.
    * **5a2**: The system logs the notification failure for administrator review.
    * **5a3**: The system retries later or allows manual resend (if supported).
* **4a**: Editor cannot be determined (missing assignment or configuration)  
    * **4a1**: The system still stores the review as submitted.
    * **4a2**: The system flags the paper/review for administrative attention.
    * **4a3**: The system logs the issue and may notify an administrator.
* **7a**: Editor lacks permission to view the review (authorization misconfiguration)  
    * **7a1**: The system denies access when editor attempts to view.
    * **7a2**: The system logs an authorization/configuration error.
    * **7a3**: The system instructs the editor to contact an administrator.
* **3a**: Duplicate delivery attempt for the same review  
    * **3a1**: The system detects the review was already delivered/notified.
    * **3a2**: The system avoids sending duplicate notifications and maintains a single review record.
* **6a**: Batch delivery (multiple reviews submitted close together)  
    * **6a1**: The system groups notifications (if supported) or sends separate notifications per review.
    * **6a2**: The editor’s in-app review list reflects all newly submitted reviews.
* **8a**: Logging/audit write fails after delivery  
    * **8a1**: Delivery is considered successful; editor access remains.
    * **8a2**: The system logs the audit failure to system logs/monitoring.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: High (during review period; per submitted review)  
* **Open Issues**:  
  * Whether “send to editor” means email delivery, in-app visibility, or both is not specified; this use case assumes **in-app availability** plus optional notifications.  
  * Whether notifications should be immediate or scheduled/batched is not specified.  
  * Whether editors should be notified only after all three reviews arrive is not specified.
