# UC-29 Scenario Narratives — Receive Final Schedule for an Accepted Paper

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-29: Receive final schedule for an accepted paper**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

An author whose paper has been accepted wants to know when and where they will present. After the conference organizers finish arranging the conference program, an administrator/editor finalizes and publishes the official conference schedule in the Conference Management System (CMS).

Once the schedule is published, the CMS stores it as the official schedule and identifies all authors who have accepted papers. For each accepted paper, the system locates the corresponding scheduled presentation details such as the assigned time slot and room.

The CMS then generates a notification for the author that includes the key schedule information. Depending on the system configuration, the notification is delivered through email, an in-app notification, or both.

The author receives the notification and accesses the schedule details. If using the in-app approach, the author logs into CMS and navigates to **My Submissions** (or **Schedule**) to locate their accepted paper. If using the email approach, the author reads the email and optionally clicks a link to open the schedule view in CMS.

The system displays the final schedule details for the author’s accepted paper, including the presentation time and room assignment. The author reviews the information and confirms when and where they will present at the conference.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 1a: Schedule Not Yet Finalized/Published

An author checks CMS to find out when they will present, but the schedule has not yet been finalized by the organizers.

When the author navigates to the schedule or submission details, the CMS detects that no published schedule is available. Instead of showing incomplete or misleading information, the system displays a clear message such as “Schedule not available yet” or “Pending schedule.”

Because the schedule has not been published, the system does not send schedule notifications to authors. The author must wait until the conference organizers publish the final schedule before receiving presentation details.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Notification Service Fails

The administrator/editor publishes the final schedule, and the CMS successfully stores the schedule and identifies authors of accepted papers.

When the system attempts to send schedule notifications, the notification service fails (for example, email delivery is unavailable or the in-app notification service is down). The CMS logs the failure and may attempt to retry sending notifications later.

Even though notifications fail, the schedule remains published and accessible in CMS. The author can still log into the system and view the schedule information under **My Submissions** or **Schedule**, ensuring the author is not blocked from accessing their presentation details.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6a: Author Not Authenticated When Attempting to View the Schedule

The author receives a schedule notification or attempts to access the schedule page directly without being logged into CMS.

When the author opens the schedule view, the CMS detects the user is not authenticated and prompts the author to log in. After successful login, the system returns the author to the relevant schedule or submission page instead of forcing them to navigate manually.

The author then views the final schedule details for their accepted paper as expected.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7a: Accepted Paper Is Not Scheduled (Missing Assignment)

The author’s paper has been accepted, and the final schedule is published. The author expects to see a time and room assignment for their presentation.

However, due to a scheduling oversight or incomplete scheduling process, the author’s accepted paper does not have a room/time assignment in the published schedule. When the author opens the schedule or submission details, the CMS displays the paper’s status but shows the schedule assignment as “Unscheduled” (or equivalent).

The system provides a message advising the author to contact the conference organizers or administrator/editor for assistance. At the same time, the system flags the missing schedule assignment for administrative attention so the organizers can correct the schedule and publish an updated version.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6b: Author Attempts to View Schedule for a Conference They Are Not Associated With

An author attempts to view schedule information for a conference or paper they are not associated with. This might happen if the author follows an incorrect link, tries to access another conference’s schedule, or manually enters a URL.

The CMS checks the author’s relationship to the conference and determines they do not have permission to access the requested schedule details. The system denies access and displays an authorization error.

The access attempt is logged (if logging is enabled) to support auditing and security monitoring. The author does not receive or view any schedule details for conferences they are not permitted to access.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 2a: Schedule Publication Fails After Finalization Attempt

An administrator/editor completes the schedule planning process and attempts to publish the final schedule. During the publication process, the system encounters an error (for example, database failure or system outage) that prevents the schedule from being marked as published.

The CMS displays an error message to the administrator/editor indicating that schedule publication failed. Because publication was unsuccessful, the schedule is not released to authors and no schedule notifications are generated.

Authors who attempt to view the schedule continue to see a “Schedule not available yet” message. The administrator/editor must resolve the system issue and successfully publish the schedule before authors can receive final schedule details.
