# Use Case UC-10: Enter manuscript metadata

**Goal in Context**: An author enters complete manuscript metadata (author names, affiliations, contact information, abstract, keywords, and main source) so the paper is fully described in CMS and can be processed correctly in the review workflow.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: Subfunction  
**Primary Actor**: Author (Registered User)  
**Secondary Actors**: CMS Database  
**Trigger**: The author opens a new paper submission form or edits a draft submission.

## Success End Condition
* All required manuscript metadata is entered, validated, and saved with the submission so the paper is fully described in CMS.

## Failed End Condition
* The manuscript metadata is incomplete or invalid and cannot be saved/submitted, and the author receives an error message explaining what must be corrected.

## Preconditions
* The author is logged in.
* The author is on the manuscript submission form (new submission or edit draft).
* The submission is in an editable state (not locked/finalized, if such a rule exists).

## Main Success Scenario
1. The author opens the manuscript submission form.
2. The system displays the manuscript metadata fields.
3. The author enters the required manuscript metadata:
   * author names,
   * affiliations,
   * contact information,
   * abstract,
   * keywords,
   * main source.
4. The author submits the form (or saves the metadata).
5. The system validates that all required metadata fields are completed.
6. The system validates the format of the metadata fields (e.g., valid email address for contact info).
7. The system stores the manuscript metadata in the database linked to the submission.
8. The system confirms that the manuscript metadata was saved successfully.

## Extensions
* **3a**: Author saves partially completed metadata as a draft  
    * **3a1**: The author selects **Save Draft**.
    * **3a2**: The system stores the currently entered metadata.
    * **3a3**: The system confirms the draft was saved.
* **5a**: One or more required metadata fields are missing  
    * **5a1**: The system displays an error message identifying missing required fields.
    * **5a2**: The system prevents final submission until the fields are completed.
* **6a**: Contact information is invalid (e.g., invalid email format)  
    * **6a1**: The system displays an error message indicating the contact information is invalid.
    * **6a2**: The system prevents saving/submission until corrected.
* **6b**: Keywords field is invalid (e.g., empty, too many, invalid separators)  
    * **6b1**: The system displays an error message indicating the keywords are invalid.
    * **6b2**: The system prevents saving/submission until corrected.
* **7a**: Database write fails while saving metadata  
    * **7a1**: The system displays an error message indicating metadata could not be saved at this time.
    * **7a2**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
    * **7a3**: The system does not save the updated metadata.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: High (required for every paper submission)  
* **Open Issues**:  
  * Exact validation rules (keyword limits, abstract length, allowed characters) are not specified in the SRS.  
  * Whether metadata can be edited after submission is not specified.  
  * Whether multiple authors and multiple affiliations must follow a specific format is not specified.
