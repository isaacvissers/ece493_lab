# UC-04 Scenario Narratives — Redirect to Login After Registration

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-04: Redirect to login after registration**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

A public user successfully completes the CMS registration form by providing valid information, including a unique email address and a password that meets security standards. After submitting the form, the system validates all inputs and creates a new user account in the CMS database.

Once the account is created, the CMS displays a success confirmation message to reassure the user that registration is complete. Immediately after this confirmation, the system redirects the user to the login page.

On the login page, the CMS presents the login form and prompts the user to enter their credentials. The user is now able to sign in right away using the account they just created, allowing them to access CMS features without needing to manually search for the login page.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4a: Redirect Fails Due to a System/Navigation Error

A user completes registration successfully and receives a confirmation message that their account has been created. The system then attempts to redirect the user to the login page so they can sign in.

However, due to a system or navigation error—such as a temporary server issue, misconfigured routing, or an unexpected client-side failure—the redirect does not complete. Instead of reaching the login page, the user remains on the confirmation page or encounters an error state.

The CMS detects the redirect failure and displays an error message indicating that the login page cannot be reached at this time. To ensure the user can still continue, the system provides a visible link or button that the user can click to navigate to the login page manually. At the same time, the CMS logs the redirect failure so an administrator can investigate and resolve the issue.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4b: System Incorrectly Logs the User In Automatically

A public user completes the registration form and submits it successfully. The CMS validates the input, creates the new account, and displays a registration success confirmation.

The system then redirects the user, but due to incorrect session handling, the user is automatically authenticated and logged into the system without explicitly entering their credentials. This behavior does not match the intended workflow of requiring users to log in manually after registration.

The CMS detects that the user has been logged in automatically in error. To correct the situation and preserve the intended authentication flow, the system logs the user out and redirects them to the login page. The CMS then displays the login form, requiring the user to sign in explicitly using their newly created credentials.
