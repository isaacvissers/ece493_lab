# UC-06 Scenario Narratives — Reject Invalid Login Credentials

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-06: Reject invalid login credentials**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

A registered user attempts to access the Conference Management System (CMS) by logging in. The user navigates to the CMS login page and enters a username and password into the login form. The user then submits the login request.

The CMS receives the login submission and checks the provided credentials against the stored credentials in the CMS database. During this validation, the system determines that the submitted credentials do not match a valid account.

To prevent unauthorized access, the CMS rejects the login attempt and does not create an authenticated session. The system displays an error message informing the user that the login credentials are invalid.

The user remains on the login page and is given the opportunity to try again by entering a different username and password.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4a: Username Does Not Exist

A user navigates to the CMS login page and attempts to log in using a username that is not registered in the system. The user enters the username and a password, then submits the login form.

The CMS queries the database for the submitted username but finds no matching account. Since the username does not exist, the system cannot authenticate the user.

The CMS rejects the login attempt and displays an error message indicating that the credentials are invalid. The system does not reveal that the username is not registered, preventing attackers from discovering valid accounts. The user remains on the login page and may try again with different credentials.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4b: Password Does Not Match Stored Password

A registered user enters a valid existing username into the login form but accidentally types the wrong password. The user submits the login request expecting to be authenticated.

The CMS looks up the username in the database and retrieves the stored authentication data. It then compares the submitted password to the stored password and determines they do not match.

To protect the system from unauthorized access, the CMS rejects the login attempt and displays an error message indicating that the credentials are invalid. The user remains unauthenticated and stays on the login page, where they can retry login using the correct password.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7a: Error Message Reveals Sensitive Information

A user submits invalid login credentials. The CMS rejects the login attempt and displays an error message. However, the error message contains sensitive information, such as stating “Username not found” or “Password incorrect.”

This behavior is a security risk because it reveals whether the username exists in the system, which could help attackers perform account enumeration.

The CMS detects that the error message reveals too much information. To correct this, the system replaces the message with a generic error such as “Invalid username or password.” The CMS logs the issue for administrator review so that the message content can be corrected permanently and security standards can be maintained.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4c: Database Lookup Fails

A user attempts to log in to CMS by entering a username and password and submitting the login form. The CMS begins the authentication process by attempting to validate the credentials using the CMS database.

During this step, the database lookup fails due to an unexpected issue such as a database outage, connection timeout, or internal server error. Because the system cannot retrieve stored credential data, it cannot confirm whether the submitted credentials are valid.

To fail safely, the CMS denies access and rejects the login attempt. The system displays an error message indicating that login cannot be completed at this time. The CMS logs the failure so that an administrator can investigate and restore normal database access. The user remains unauthenticated and must try again later once the system is functioning correctly.
