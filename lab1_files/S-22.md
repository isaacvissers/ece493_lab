# UC-22 Scenario Narratives — Validate Review Form Fields (No Invalid Characters / No Blanks)

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-22: Validate review form fields**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

A reviewer fills out the review form for an assigned paper in the Conference Management System (CMS). When the reviewer clicks **Save Draft** or **Submit Review**, the CMS runs validation on the form fields. The system checks that required fields are not left blank (especially for submission) and that text inputs do not contain disallowed or invalid characters. It also verifies any configured formatting or range constraints.

The validation finds no errors. Because the input is clean and complete, the CMS saves the review data to the database (as a draft or as a submitted review, depending on the action). The reviewer sees a confirmation message indicating the review was saved or submitted successfully, and the stored review remains consistent and usable for editor decision-making.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Required Field Is Blank

A reviewer attempts to save or submit the review form, but one or more required fields are left blank. When the reviewer initiates the save/submit action, the CMS validates the inputs and detects missing required information.

The system blocks the action (or blocks submission if drafts allow partial completion). The CMS highlights the blank required fields and presents an error summary explaining what is missing. The reviewer fills in the missing required fields and retries the action. Once the blanks are resolved, the system allows the review to be saved or submitted.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3b: Field Contains Invalid Characters

A reviewer enters text into a field that includes invalid characters—for example, disallowed control characters or prohibited markup. When the reviewer attempts to save or submit the review, the CMS validation detects that the field violates the character rules.

The system blocks saving/submitting the review. The CMS highlights the offending field and provides a message explaining that invalid characters were detected (and, if supported, indicates the character rule violated). The reviewer edits the input to remove the invalid characters and retries. After correction, the system accepts the input and saves/submits the review.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3c: Multiple Validation Errors Across Fields

A reviewer submits a review form that contains several issues at once—for example, a missing required rating, an empty overall recommendation, and invalid characters in a comment field.

When the reviewer attempts to save or submit, the CMS runs validation and detects multiple errors. Rather than stopping at the first failure, the system provides a consolidated error summary and highlights all invalid fields at once.

The reviewer corrects each issue based on the feedback and retries the action. Once all errors are resolved, the review is saved or submitted successfully.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 2a: Input Exceeds Maximum Length

A reviewer writes an extremely long comment that exceeds the system’s maximum allowed length for a text field. When the reviewer clicks save or submit, the CMS validation checks field length constraints and detects that the input is too long.

The system blocks the action and informs the reviewer of the maximum allowed length. The CMS highlights the field and prompts the reviewer to shorten the input. After the reviewer reduces the text to within the allowed length, the system validates successfully and saves/submits the review.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Database Write Fails After Validation Passes

A reviewer completes the review form and clicks save or submit. The CMS validates the inputs and finds no errors. The system then attempts to persist the review data in the database.

During this persistence step, a database failure occurs (such as a timeout or outage). The CMS cannot store the review. The system displays an error indicating the review could not be saved/submitted at this time and logs the failure for administrator review.

The review is not stored/updated. The reviewer may retry later once the system is functioning normally.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3d: Validation Rules Unavailable (Configuration Error)

A reviewer attempts to save or submit a review, but the CMS cannot load the validation rules due to a configuration issue (for example, missing rule definitions for required fields or allowed character sets).

Because the system cannot reliably validate inputs, it fails safely by blocking the save/submit action. The CMS informs the reviewer that the action cannot be completed at this time and logs the configuration problem for administrator review.

Once the configuration issue is resolved, validation can run normally and reviewers can save/submit reviews again.
