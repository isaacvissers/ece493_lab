# Use Case UC-21: Submit completed review form

**Goal in Context**: A reviewer submits a completed review form so their evaluation is stored in CMS and shared with the editor for decision-making.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Reviewer (Referee)  
**Secondary Actors**: Editor; CMS Database; Authentication Service; Notification Service (optional)  
**Trigger**: The reviewer selects **Submit Review** on the review form for an assigned paper.

## Success End Condition
* The review is validated and stored successfully, the review status becomes **Submitted**, and the editor can view the reviewer’s evaluation.

## Failed End Condition
* The review is not saved as submitted (due to validation errors, deadline restrictions, system failures), and the reviewer receives an error message explaining what must be fixed or that submission cannot be completed.

## Preconditions
* The reviewer is logged in.
* The reviewer has an accepted assignment for the paper and is authorized to review it.
* The review form is available and accessible to the reviewer (UC-20).
* The review period is open for submission (if deadlines are enforced).
* The reviewer has entered review information (at least minimally) in the form.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The reviewer opens the review form for an assigned paper.
2. The reviewer completes the required review fields (e.g., ratings, comments, recommendation).
3. The reviewer selects **Submit Review**.
4. The system validates the review input (required fields present, valid ranges/formats).
5. The system stores the completed review in the database and marks it as **Submitted**.
6. The system displays a confirmation that the review was submitted successfully.
7. The system makes the submitted review available to the editor (e.g., in the editor’s paper review view).
8. (Optional) The system sends notifications (e.g., to editor) that a review has been submitted.

    * **4a3**: The reviewer corrects the issues and retries submission.
* **0a**: Review period is closed (deadline passed)  
    * **0a1**: The system blocks submission.
    * **0a2**: The system informs the reviewer that the review period is closed.
    * **0a3**: The system may allow read-only viewing of previously saved draft content.
* **3a**: Reviewer is not authenticated (session expired)  
    * **3a1**: The system prompts the reviewer to log in.
    * **3a2**: After login, the system returns the reviewer to the review form.
    * **3a3**: The reviewer retries submission.
* **5a**: Database write fails while saving the submitted review  
    * **5a1**: The system displays an error indicating the review could not be submitted at this time.
    * **5a2**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.

    * **6a1**: The system detects the review is already submitted.
    * **6a2**: The system prevents duplicate submission and informs the reviewer.
    * **6a3**: If edits after submission are allowed, the system follows the configured “resubmit/update” workflow (if any).
* **8a**: Notification sending fails after successful submission (optional)
