# Use Case UC-17: Ensure each paper has exactly three referees assigned

**Goal in Context**: The system ensures each submitted paper has **three referees assigned** so the review process is complete and papers can proceed through the review workflow with sufficient coverage.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: Summary / Subfunction (System Enforcement)  
**Primary Actor**: System (CMS)  
**Secondary Actors**: Editor; CMS Database; Email/Notification Service (optional)  
**Trigger**: A paper enters the “Ready for Review” stage (or an editor attempts to start review), or a referee assignment action occurs that changes the referee count for a paper.

## Success End Condition
* The paper has exactly three referee assignments recorded (and, if configured, all three invitations are issued), allowing the paper to proceed into the review process.

## Failed End Condition
* The paper has fewer than three referees assigned (insufficient coverage) or more than three referees assigned (violates policy), and the system blocks progression and/or notifies the editor so the issue can be corrected.

## Preconditions
* A paper exists in the system and is eligible for the review process.
* The system has a way to count current referee assignments for the paper.
* The referee assignment policy is configured as “3 referees per paper.”
* Editors have access to referee assignment controls to resolve gaps/excess.

## Main Success Scenario
1. A paper reaches a checkpoint that requires referee readiness (e.g., editor attempts to start review or paper status moves to **Ready for Review**).
2. The system retrieves the current referee assignments for the paper.
3. The system determines that exactly three referees are assigned.
4. The system marks the paper as ready for review and allows the review workflow to proceed.
5. The system records the readiness decision (audit/log) and (optionally) ensures invitations have been sent to the three referees.

## Extensions
* **3a**: Fewer than three referees are assigned  
    * **3a1**: The system blocks progression to the review stage.
    * **3a2**: The system notifies the editor that the paper requires three referee assignments and indicates the current count.
    * **3a3**: The system provides a link/action to assign additional referees.
* **3b**: More than three referees are assigned  
    * **3b1**: The system blocks progression (or flags the paper) because the assignment policy is violated.
    * **3b2**: The system notifies the editor that there are too many referees assigned and indicates the current count.
    * **3b3**: The system provides a link/action to remove/unassign a referee (if supported) or to resolve via admin.
* **2a**: Assignment count cannot be determined (database/lookup failure)  
    * **2a1**: The system blocks progression (fail safe).
    * **2a2**: The system notifies the editor that readiness cannot be evaluated at this time.
    * **2a3**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
* **5a**: Invitations not sent to all three referees (notification failure)  
    * **5a1**: The system records that the paper has three referees assigned, but flags the missing invitations.
    * **5a2**: The system notifies the editor that one or more invitations could not be sent and logs the failure.
    * **5a3**: The system allows resending invitations (if supported).
* **3c**: Editor attempts to assign a 4th referee  
    * **3c1**: The system blocks the assignment and notifies the editor that only three referees are allowed for this policy.
    * **3c2**: The system suggests replacing an existing referee rather than adding a fourth (if replacement is supported).

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Medium (per paper, during assignment and review stage transitions)  
* **Open Issues**:  
  * Whether “3 referees” means exactly three or at least three is not specified; this use case assumes **exactly three**.  
  * Whether editors can override the policy is not specified.  
  * Whether unassignment/replacement functionality exists is not specified.
