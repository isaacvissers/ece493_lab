# Acceptance Test Suite — UC-27 View Conference Schedule in HTML Format

## Scope
Validate that an administrator/editor can view the conference schedule in **HTML format**, and that CMS:
- enforces schedule view permissions,
- renders the latest schedule into readable HTML,
- handles missing schedules and partial schedules gracefully,
- handles rendering errors and performance issues safely,
- presents enough structure to support easy review (time/room per paper).

Covers UC-27 extensions (4a, 3a, 5a, 4b, 6a).

## Assumptions / Notes
- HTML schedule view may be either a room/time grid or a list/agenda layout; tests focus on presence and correctness of required information.
- Browser-level actions (print/save) are outside CMS control but the HTML should be printable/readable.
- If schedules have draft vs published states, the view should clearly indicate which is displayed or allow selection.

## Test Data
- **Admin/editor (authorized)**: `admin1@example.com` / `editor1@example.com`
- **Unauthorized user**: `userX@example.com`
- Schedules:
  - **Published schedule** exists for conference `CONF-01`
  - **Draft schedule** exists for conference `CONF-01`
  - **No schedule** exists for conference `CONF-02`
  - **Partial schedule** (some unscheduled papers) for `CONF-03`
- Failure simulations:
  - Rendering/template failure
  - Large schedule with many entries (performance)

# Test Cases

## AT-UC27-01 — Authorized user can open HTML schedule view and see time/room assignments (Happy Path)
**Objective:** Ensure HTML schedule view renders successfully.  
**Preconditions:** Schedule exists for `CONF-01`; authorized user logged in.  
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to **Scheduling**.
2. Select **View Schedule (HTML)**.
**Expected Results:**
- HTML page loads successfully.
- Each scheduled paper displayed includes a time slot and room.
- No obvious formatting breakage (page readable, headings/sections present).

---

## AT-UC27-02 — HTML view shows the latest schedule (draft/published per configuration)
**Objective:** Ensure correct version is displayed.  
**Preconditions:** Both draft and published schedules exist (or a known “latest” state).  
**Steps:**
1. Open HTML schedule view.
2. Compare displayed schedule version/state to expected configuration (latest/draft/published).
**Expected Results:**
- The correct schedule version is displayed.
- If draft is shown, it is labeled as draft (if applicable).
- Time/room assignments match stored schedule data.

---

## AT-UC27-03 — No schedule exists: system shows clear message and does not render broken page (Extension 4a)
**Objective:** Graceful handling of absent schedule.  
**Preconditions:** No schedule exists for `CONF-02`; authorized user logged in.  
**Steps:**
1. Open HTML schedule view for `CONF-02`.
**Expected Results:**
- User sees “No schedule available” (or equivalent).
- Page remains functional and readable.
- Optional: link/button to generate schedule is present (if supported).

---

## AT-UC27-04 — Unauthorized user is blocked from HTML schedule view (Extension 3a)
**Objective:** Enforce access control.  
**Preconditions:** `userX@example.com` lacks schedule viewing permission.  
**Steps:**
1. Log in as userX.
2. Attempt to open HTML schedule view.
**Expected Results:**
- Access denied / authorization error shown.
- No schedule content is displayed.
- Attempt logged (if logging exists).

---

## AT-UC27-05 — Rendering failure shows error message and logs incident (Extension 5a)
**Objective:** Safe failure on render errors.  
**Preconditions:** Simulate template/rendering failure while schedule exists.  
**Steps:**
1. Authorized user opens HTML schedule view.
2. Trigger rendering failure.
**Expected Results:**
- System displays an error indicating schedule cannot be rendered.
- No partially garbled content is shown as “successful” output.
- Failure is logged for admin review.

---

## AT-UC27-06 — Partial schedule renders with unscheduled items clearly labeled (Extension 4b)
**Objective:** Ensure partial drafts are reviewable.  
**Preconditions:** Partial schedule exists for `CONF-03` with unscheduled papers.  
**Steps:**
1. Open HTML schedule view for `CONF-03`.
**Expected Results:**
- Scheduled papers show room/time assignments.
- Unscheduled papers appear in a clearly labeled section or marked “Unscheduled”.
- Page does not crash and remains readable.

---

## AT-UC27-07 — Large schedule loads with progress indication and without timeout, or fails gracefully (Extension 6a)
**Objective:** Validate performance behavior.  
**Preconditions:** Large schedule exists (many papers/slots).  
**Steps:**
1. Open HTML schedule view for large schedule conference.
2. Observe loading behavior and completion time.
**Expected Results:**
- System shows loading indicator if rendering is slow.
- Page loads successfully within acceptable time, OR
- If timeout occurs, system shows a timeout/performance error and logs it.
- No blank/white page without explanation.

---

# Exit Criteria (Definition of Done for UC-27)
UC-27 is accepted when:
- Authorized admins/editors can view schedule as HTML with correct time/room info (AT-UC27-01, AT-UC27-02), and
- No-schedule and partial-schedule states render clearly and safely (AT-UC27-03, AT-UC27-06), and
- Unauthorized access is blocked (AT-UC27-04), and
- Rendering/performance failures fail gracefully with clear messaging and logging (AT-UC27-05, AT-UC27-07).
