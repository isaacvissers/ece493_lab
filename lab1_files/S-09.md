# UC-09 Scenario Narratives — Upload Manuscript File Within Constraints

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-09: Upload manuscript file within constraints**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

An author is preparing a paper submission in the Conference Management System (CMS). While completing the manuscript submission form, the author reaches the section for uploading the manuscript file. The author selects the **Upload Manuscript** option and chooses a file from their device.

Once the file is selected, the CMS validates it before accepting the upload. The system checks that the file is in one of the supported formats—PDF, Word, or LaTeX. It then verifies that the file size does not exceed the maximum allowed size of 7MB.

Because the selected manuscript meets both constraints, the CMS uploads the file successfully and stores it in the system’s file storage. The CMS confirms that the upload was successful and attaches the manuscript file to the author’s submission so it can be included in the conference review process.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4a: File Type Is Not Accepted

An author attempts to upload a manuscript file while completing the submission form. The author selects **Upload Manuscript** and chooses a file from their device. However, the selected file is not in an accepted format (for example, a `.txt` file or an image).

The CMS checks the file type and determines it does not match one of the supported formats (PDF, Word, or LaTeX). The system rejects the file and does not upload it.

The CMS displays an error message explaining that the file type is not accepted and lists the allowed formats. The author is prompted to choose a different file in a supported format before the submission can proceed.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: File Size Exceeds 7MB

An author selects a manuscript file in a supported format and attempts to upload it. Although the file type is valid, the file size is larger than the maximum allowed size of 7MB.

The CMS checks the file size and detects that it exceeds the system constraint. The system rejects the upload request and does not store the file.

The CMS displays an error message informing the author that the file is too large and exceeds the 7MB limit. The author must select a smaller version of the manuscript (for example, by compressing the file or exporting it with reduced size) and attempt the upload again.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6a: File Upload Fails (Network/Server Error)

An author selects a valid manuscript file and initiates the upload process. During the upload, a network interruption occurs or the server experiences a temporary issue. The file upload does not complete successfully.

The CMS detects the upload failure and informs the author that the upload failed. The system does not attach the file to the submission because it was not successfully transferred or stored.

The CMS provides the author with the option to retry the upload. The author can attempt the upload again once their network connection is stable or the system becomes available.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6b: Storage Service/Database Write Fails

An author selects a valid manuscript file that meets format and size requirements. The CMS successfully receives the file upload and attempts to store it in its file storage service (or database).

During the storage step, an unexpected failure occurs—such as a storage outage, permission issue, or database write error. The CMS cannot save the file permanently.

The system displays an error message indicating that the file could not be stored. The CMS logs the failure for administrator review. Since the file was not stored, it is not attached to the submission, and the author must retry the upload later.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Author Cancels File Selection

An author opens the file selection dialog by clicking **Upload Manuscript** but decides not to upload a file yet. The author cancels the file selection window without choosing a file.

The CMS detects that no file was selected. The system returns the author to the submission form without uploading anything. The submission remains unchanged, and no manuscript file is attached. The author may choose to upload a file later before final submission.
