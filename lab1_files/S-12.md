# UC-12 Scenario Narratives — Save Submission Progress (Draft)

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-12: Save submission progress (draft)**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

An author is preparing a paper submission in the Conference Management System (CMS). While working through the submission form, the author enters some manuscript metadata, and may also upload a manuscript file, but is not ready to finalize the submission. The author wants to ensure their progress is not lost if they need to stop and return later.

At any point during editing, the author clicks **Save Draft**. The CMS captures the current submission state, including all metadata fields that have been filled in so far and any manuscript file that has been uploaded. The system stores this draft state in the database (and in file storage for the uploaded file).

The CMS displays a confirmation message indicating that the draft was saved successfully. Later, when the author returns to the CMS, they open their drafts list and select the saved draft submission. The CMS retrieves the stored draft state and displays the previously entered information so the author can continue editing from where they left off, without having lost any work.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Draft Saved with Incomplete or Invalid Final-Submission Fields

An author begins a submission but has not completed all required fields for final submission. For example, the author may still be refining the abstract, may not have selected keywords yet, or may not have uploaded the final manuscript file. Some fields might also be temporarily invalid (such as a partially typed email address).

The author clicks **Save Draft** to preserve progress. The CMS saves the draft even though the submission is not ready for final submission. The system may warn the author that required fields are incomplete and that the draft cannot be finalized until issues are corrected.

The author later returns, completes the missing fields, corrects invalid values, and proceeds toward final submission.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Database/Storage Write Fails While Saving the Draft

An author clicks **Save Draft** after entering submission information. The CMS attempts to store the draft state in the database and store any uploaded file.

During this save operation, an unexpected database or storage failure occurs, such as a timeout or outage. The CMS cannot save the new draft state.

The system displays an error message informing the author that the draft could not be saved at this time. The CMS logs the failure for administrator review. Importantly, the system does not overwrite any previously saved draft state, preventing accidental loss of earlier work. The author must retry saving later once the system is functioning normally.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 2a: Author Not Authenticated (Session Expired)

An author has been working on a submission form for some time. When they click **Save Draft**, the CMS detects that their session has expired and they are no longer authenticated.

To protect the author’s account and data, the CMS redirects the author to the login page and asks them to sign in again. After successful login, the CMS returns the author to the submission form so they can continue working. The author then clicks **Save Draft** again to store their progress.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6a: Confirmation Message Not Displayed (UI Feedback Failure)

An author clicks **Save Draft**. The CMS successfully stores the draft state in the database, but due to a UI feedback issue (such as a failed notification component), the success confirmation message does not appear.

Even though the message is missing, the draft is still saved successfully. The CMS provides alternate evidence that saving occurred, such as updating a “Last saved at” timestamp on the page. The author can also verify saving by leaving the page and reopening the draft later with the latest changes present.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7a: Draft Cannot Be Reopened (Draft Retrieval Failure)

An author previously saved a draft submission and returns later to continue editing. The author selects the draft from their drafts list.

The CMS attempts to retrieve the draft from the database, but a retrieval failure occurs due to a database issue, service outage, or unexpected error. The system cannot load the saved submission state.

The CMS displays an error message indicating that the draft cannot be loaded at this time. The system logs the failure for administrator review. The author is unable to continue editing until the retrieval issue is resolved.
