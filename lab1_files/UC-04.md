# Use Case UC-04: Redirect to login after registration

**Goal in Context**: After a user successfully registers a new account, the system redirects them to the login page so they can sign in immediately and access CMS features.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: Subfunction  
**Primary Actor**: User (Public User / Guest)  
**Secondary Actors**: None  
**Trigger**: The system completes a successful registration and displays a success confirmation.

## Success End Condition
* The user is redirected to the login page after successful registration and can proceed to authenticate.

## Failed End Condition
* The user is not redirected to the login page after successful registration, preventing immediate sign-in.

## Preconditions
* The user has successfully submitted a valid registration form.
* The system has created the new user account and stored it in the database.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The user completes and submits the registration form.
2. The system validates the registration data and creates the user account.
3. The system displays a success confirmation message indicating registration is complete.
4. The system redirects the user to the login page.
5. The system displays the login form so the user can enter their credentials.

## Extensions
* **4a**: Redirect fails due to a system/navigation error  
    * **4a1**: The system displays an error message indicating the login page cannot be reached at this time.
    * **4a2**: The system provides a visible link/button to navigate to the login page manually.
    * **4a3**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
* **4b**: Session state incorrectly logs the user in automatically  
    * **4b1**: The system logs the user out and redirects them to the login page.
    * **4b2**: The system displays the login form, requiring explicit authentication.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Medium (occurs after every successful registration)  
* **Open Issues**:  
  * Whether the system should automatically log in the user after registration is not specified; this use case assumes **manual login is required**.  
  * Exact UI wording for success confirmation and redirect timing are not specified.
