# Use Case UC-09: Upload manuscript file within constraints

**Goal in Context**: An author uploads a manuscript file in an accepted format (PDF, Word, or LaTeX) and within the size limit (≤ 7MB) so the submission meets CMS system constraints.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: Subfunction  
**Primary Actor**: Author (Registered User)  
**Secondary Actors**: File Storage Service (or CMS Database); Virus/Malware Scanner (if implemented)  
**Trigger**: The author selects a manuscript file to upload as part of a paper submission.

## Success End Condition
* The manuscript file is uploaded successfully, passes validation (type and size), and is stored/attached to the submission.

## Failed End Condition
* The manuscript file is not accepted or not uploaded, and the author receives an error message explaining the issue.

## Preconditions
* The author is logged in.
* The author is on the manuscript submission form (new submission or edit draft).
* The author has a manuscript file available on their device.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The author opens the manuscript submission form.
2. The author selects the **Upload Manuscript** option.
3. The author chooses a manuscript file from their device.
4. The system checks that the file type is accepted (PDF, Word, or LaTeX).
5. The system checks that the file size is within the allowed limit (≤ 7MB).
6. The system uploads the file and stores it in CMS storage.
7. The system confirms the file upload was successful and attaches it to the submission.
