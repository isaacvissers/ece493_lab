# Use Case UC-27: View conference schedule in HTML format

**Goal in Context**: An administrator/editor views the conference schedule in **HTML format** so it can be reviewed easily (and prepared for web publication).  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Administrator/Editor  
**Secondary Actors**: CMS Database; Schedule Rendering Service (HTML); Web Browser (client)  
**Trigger**: The administrator/editor selects **View Schedule (HTML)** from the scheduling area.

## Success End Condition
* The system displays the current conference schedule as a well-formatted HTML page that the user can review (e.g., by time, room, session).

## Failed End Condition
* The schedule cannot be displayed in HTML due to missing schedule data, permission issues, rendering errors, or system failures.

## Preconditions
* The user is logged into CMS.
* The user has permission to view schedules (admin/editor role).
* A schedule exists (draft or published) for the conference, OR the system supports showing an empty schedule state.
* The system has an HTML rendering/view mechanism for the schedule.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The administrator/editor logs into CMS.
2. The user navigates to the conference **Scheduling** area.
3. The user selects **View Schedule (HTML)**.
4. The system retrieves the latest schedule (draft or published per configuration).
5. The system renders the schedule into HTML, including time and room assignments for accepted papers.
6. The system displays the HTML schedule page in the user’s browser.
7. The user reviews the schedule and optionally uses browser functions (print/save page) to share or archive it.

## Extensions
* **4a**: No schedule exists yet  
    * **4a1**: The system displays a clear “No schedule available” message (and optionally provides a link to generate one).
    * **4a2**: The system does not display incomplete/garbled content.
* **3a**: User not authorized to view schedule  
    * **3a1**: The system denies access and shows an authorization error.
    * **3a2**: The system logs the access attempt.
* **5a**: Rendering fails due to template or data error  
    * **5a1**: The system shows an error indicating the schedule could not be rendered.
    * **5a2**: The system logs the rendering failure for administrator review.
    * **5a3**: The user may retry after the issue is resolved.
* **4b**: Schedule contains missing/invalid entries (e.g., unscheduled papers in partial draft)  
    * **4b1**: The system renders the schedule and clearly labels unscheduled items (e.g., “Unscheduled” section).
    * **4b2**: The system does not crash; it preserves readability.
* **6a**: Large schedule takes too long to load  
    * **6a1**: The system shows a loading indicator and completes rendering within acceptable time.
    * **6a2**: If timeout occurs, the system shows a timeout/error message and logs performance issues.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: Medium
