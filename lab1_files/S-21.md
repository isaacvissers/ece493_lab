# UC-21 Scenario Narratives — Submit Completed Review Form

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-21: Submit completed review form**.

---

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

A reviewer logs into the Conference Management System (CMS) and opens the review form for a paper assigned to them. The reviewer reads the manuscript, completes the required fields on the form—such as ratings, comments, and an overall recommendation—and then clicks **Submit Review**.

The CMS validates the review input to ensure all required fields are present and that values are within acceptable ranges or formats. Since everything is complete and valid, the CMS stores the review in the database and updates its status to **Submitted**.

The system displays a confirmation message to the reviewer indicating the review was submitted successfully. The submitted review becomes visible to the editor in the paper’s review view, allowing the editor to consider the reviewer’s evaluation during the decision process. If configured, the CMS also notifies the editor that a new review has been submitted.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 4a: Review Validation Fails

A reviewer completes the review form but accidentally leaves a required field blank or enters an invalid value (for example, a rating outside the allowed range). When the reviewer clicks **Submit Review**, the CMS validates the input and detects the problem.

The system does not submit the review. Instead, it highlights the missing or invalid fields and displays an error summary explaining what must be corrected. The reviewer updates the form to fix the issues and then attempts submission again. Once all validation errors are resolved, the review can be submitted successfully.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 0a: Review Period Is Closed (Deadline Passed)

A reviewer attempts to submit a review after the review deadline has passed. When the reviewer clicks **Submit Review**, the CMS checks the review schedule and determines the review period is closed.

The system blocks submission and informs the reviewer that the review period is closed. The reviewer cannot submit or change review content. Depending on policy, the CMS may still allow the reviewer to view any saved draft content in read-only mode, but the review cannot be submitted once the period is closed.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Reviewer Not Authenticated (Session Expired)

A reviewer has the review form open and clicks **Submit Review**, but their session has expired. The CMS detects the reviewer is not authenticated.

The system prompts the reviewer to log in again. After successful login, the CMS returns the reviewer to the review form so they can continue without losing context. The reviewer clicks **Submit Review** again to complete the submission.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Database Write Fails During Submission

A reviewer completes the review form and submits it. The CMS validates the review successfully and then attempts to save it as **Submitted** in the database.

During the save operation, a database failure occurs (such as a timeout or outage). The CMS cannot complete the submission. The system displays an error indicating the review could not be submitted at this time and logs the failure for administrator review.

The review remains unsubmitted. If the system supports draft saving, the reviewer’s entered content is preserved as a draft so they do not lose their work. The reviewer can retry submission later once the system is functioning normally.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3b: Reviewer Attempts to Submit for an Unauthorized Paper

A reviewer attempts to submit a review for a paper that is not assigned to them—perhaps by using a direct link or trying to access another paper’s form.

When the reviewer clicks **Submit Review**, the CMS checks authorization and determines the reviewer is not permitted to submit a review for that paper. The system denies the submission and displays an authorization error. No review data is stored or updated.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6a: Duplicate Submission Attempt (Already Submitted)

A reviewer successfully submits a review for a paper and receives confirmation. Later, the reviewer returns to the review form and clicks **Submit Review** again, either accidentally or to attempt to change the evaluation.

The CMS checks the review status and detects that the review has already been submitted. The system prevents duplicate submission and informs the reviewer that the review is already submitted. If the CMS supports edits after submission, the system follows the configured update/resubmit workflow; otherwise, the form remains read-only or locked.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 8a: Notification Sending Fails After Successful Submission (Optional)

A reviewer submits a completed review successfully, and the CMS stores it as **Submitted**. After storing, the system attempts to notify the editor that a new review has arrived.

The notification service fails (for example, email outage). Even though the editor notification fails, the review remains successfully submitted and visible to the editor within CMS. The system logs the notification failure and may allow retry or send later once the service is restored.
