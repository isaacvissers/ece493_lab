# UC-24 Scenario Narratives — Make Final Accept/Reject Decision After 3 Reviews Are Complete

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-24: Make final accept/reject decision after 3 reviews are complete**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

An editor logs into the Conference Management System (CMS) to make final decisions on submitted papers. From the editor dashboard, the editor navigates to the list of papers that are ready for decision-making (for example, **Papers to Decide**).

The CMS displays papers that have exactly three completed reviews and are eligible for a final decision. The editor selects one of these papers. The system displays the paper details along with the three submitted reviews so the editor can evaluate the reviewers’ feedback and recommendations.

After reading the reviews, the editor selects **Make Decision**. The editor chooses either **Accept** or **Reject**, and may optionally enter decision comments to record the reasoning or provide additional notes.

Before saving, the CMS verifies that the paper still has exactly three completed reviews and that the editor is authorized to make the decision. Since the conditions are satisfied, the CMS stores the decision in the database and updates the paper’s status to **Accepted** or **Rejected** accordingly.

The system displays a confirmation message indicating the decision has been saved successfully. If the system is configured to notify authors or update downstream workflow steps, the CMS triggers those updates (for example, accepted papers are made available for scheduling).

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Paper Does Not Yet Have Three Completed Reviews

An editor attempts to make a final decision on a paper, but the paper has fewer than three completed reviews. The editor selects the paper expecting it to be ready, but the CMS shows that one or more reviews are missing or still incomplete.

When the editor clicks **Make Decision**, the CMS checks the review status and determines that the required condition of three completed reviews has not been met. The system prevents the editor from recording a final decision and displays a message explaining that a final decision requires three completed reviews.

The CMS also shows the current number of completed reviews and which reviews are still pending. The editor must wait for additional reviews to be completed before returning to make the final decision.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3b: More Than Three Reviews Exist for the Paper

An editor selects a paper for decision-making. The CMS displays the paper and its reviews, but the editor notices that more than three reviews are attached to the paper.

When the editor attempts to proceed with **Make Decision**, the CMS detects that the review count exceeds the expected number. Because this violates the conference review process rules, the system alerts the editor that the review count is incorrect and blocks decision entry until the issue is corrected.

The editor is required to resolve the inconsistency—such as removing an extra assignment or marking an extra review as invalid—before the system will allow a final accept/reject decision to be recorded.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 8a: Editor Not Authorized to Decide for This Paper

An editor logs into CMS and attempts to make a decision on a paper that is not assigned to them or is outside their permission scope. The editor navigates to the paper and selects **Make Decision**.

The CMS verifies authorization and determines that the editor does not have permission to record a final decision for that paper. The system blocks access to the decision entry action and displays an authorization error message.

The CMS logs the permission failure for administrative review. The editor cannot proceed until permissions are corrected or the paper is reassigned to the appropriate editor.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 9a: Database Write Fails While Saving the Decision

An editor reviews the three completed reviews and chooses **Accept** or **Reject**, then submits the final decision. The CMS validates eligibility and authorization successfully and attempts to store the decision in the database.

During the save operation, a database failure occurs (such as a timeout or outage). The CMS cannot store the decision or update the paper status. The system displays an error indicating the decision could not be saved at this time and logs the failure for administrator review.

The paper remains in its prior state with no final decision recorded. The editor must retry saving the decision later once the system is functioning properly.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7a: Editor Attempts to Submit Without Selecting Accept/Reject

An editor opens a paper that is eligible for decision-making and selects **Make Decision**. However, the editor attempts to save the decision without choosing either **Accept** or **Reject** (for example, leaving the decision selection blank).

When the editor clicks submit, the CMS validates the decision input and detects that no decision value was selected. The system blocks saving and prompts the editor to choose either **Accept** or **Reject** before proceeding.

The editor selects the appropriate decision and retries. Once a valid decision is selected, the system saves it successfully.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 11a: Notification Sending Fails After Decision Is Saved (Optional)

An editor successfully records a final decision for a paper, and the CMS stores the decision and updates the paper status accordingly. After saving, the system attempts to notify the author(s) of the decision or trigger other workflow updates.

The notification service fails (for example, email service outage). Even though the notification fails, the decision remains stored correctly and the paper status remains updated.

The CMS logs the notification failure for administrator review and may retry later if supported. The editor does not need to re-enter the decision, and authors can still see the updated decision once notification delivery is restored or via direct login.
