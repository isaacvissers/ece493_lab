# UC-18 Scenario Narratives — View Accepted Assigned Paper in Reviewer Account

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-18: View accepted assigned paper in reviewer account**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

A reviewer receives a review invitation and chooses to accept it. When the reviewer clicks **Accept** (either from the email invitation or within the CMS), the Conference Management System (CMS) records the reviewer’s acceptance and updates the assignment status to **Accepted**.

The reviewer then signs into CMS (if they are not already logged in) and navigates to their reviewer dashboard, where assigned papers are listed. The CMS retrieves all accepted assignments for the reviewer from the database and displays them in the reviewer’s **My Assigned Papers** list.

The newly accepted paper appears in the list. The reviewer selects the paper, and the CMS opens the paper details page. The system provides access to the manuscript and relevant submission information so the reviewer can begin the review work.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Reviewer Is Not Authenticated

A reviewer accepts the invitation link but is not currently authenticated in CMS because their session has expired or they are not logged in. After accepting, the reviewer attempts to open their dashboard to find the assigned paper.

The CMS detects that the reviewer is not authenticated and prompts them to log in. After the reviewer successfully signs in, the CMS returns them to the reviewer dashboard (or directly to the paper access page, depending on the system design). The reviewer then sees the accepted paper in their assigned papers list and can proceed.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6a: Accepted Paper Does Not Appear Due to Synchronization Delay

A reviewer accepts an invitation and then immediately checks their **My Assigned Papers** list. Because the system may update assignments asynchronously, the accepted paper is not visible right away.

The CMS informs the reviewer that assignment updates may take a short time to appear and suggests refreshing the page. The reviewer refreshes the list after a brief delay. Once synchronization completes, the paper appears in the reviewer’s assigned papers list, and the reviewer can open it to begin review work.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6b: Assignment Not Recorded as Accepted

A reviewer clicks the **Accept** link in the invitation email. However, due to an earlier system error, the acceptance is not successfully recorded in the database. The reviewer logs in and checks their assigned papers list, but the paper does not appear.

The CMS indicates that no accepted assignment exists for that paper. The reviewer is instructed to retry accepting the invitation (for example, using a valid invitation link) or contact the editor if the problem persists.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 8a: Reviewer Attempts to Access Paper Without Accepting Invitation

A reviewer receives an invitation email but does not accept it. The reviewer tries to access the paper directly (for example, by clicking a paper link or navigating within CMS) before accepting.

The CMS checks the assignment status and determines the invitation has not been accepted. To enforce review access rules, the system denies access to the paper and informs the reviewer that they must accept the invitation before they can view the manuscript and perform the review.

The reviewer must accept the invitation to proceed.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 8b: Paper/Manuscript Is Unavailable

A reviewer accepts an invitation and navigates to their assigned papers list. The paper appears as expected. When the reviewer selects the paper to open it, the CMS attempts to load the paper details and provide access to the manuscript file.

However, the manuscript is unavailable—perhaps because the paper was withdrawn, removed, or the file was corrupted or missing. The CMS displays an error indicating the paper or manuscript is unavailable and prevents access to the manuscript.

The system logs the issue and may notify the editor so the problem can be resolved. The reviewer cannot proceed until the manuscript is restored or the assignment is updated.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Database Retrieval Fails When Loading Assignments

A reviewer logs in after accepting an invitation and navigates to their reviewer dashboard. The CMS attempts to retrieve the reviewer’s accepted assignments from the database, but a database error occurs (such as a timeout or outage).

The CMS cannot load the assignments list. The system displays an error indicating that assignments cannot be loaded at this time and logs the failure for administrator review. The reviewer is instructed to retry later. Once the database is available again, the reviewer can reload the dashboard and see the accepted paper.
