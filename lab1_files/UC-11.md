# Use Case UC-11: Validate paper submission fields

**Goal in Context**: When an author submits (or saves) a paper submission, the system validates submission fields—ensuring no required blanks, a valid contact email, and an acceptable manuscript file type—so that submission errors are caught early and invalid submissions are prevented.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: Subfunction  
**Primary Actor**: Author (Registered User)  
**Secondary Actors**: CMS Database (for lookup/persistence as part of workflow)  
**Trigger**: The author attempts to submit a paper (or save a submission as final) from the manuscript submission form.

## Success End Condition
* The system confirms all required fields are complete and valid (including contact email and file type), and allows the submission workflow to proceed.

## Failed End Condition
* The system detects invalid or missing data, blocks final submission, and displays error messages identifying what must be corrected.

## Preconditions
* The author is logged in.
* The author is on the manuscript submission form (new submission or edit draft).
* The author has entered manuscript metadata and selected a manuscript file for upload (or is attempting to do so).

## Main Success Scenario
1. The author completes the manuscript submission form and initiates **Submit** (final submission).
2. The system validates that all required fields are present (no blanks for required metadata fields).
3. The system validates that the contact email address is in a valid format.
4. The system validates that a manuscript file is provided and that its file type is accepted (PDF, Word, or LaTeX).
5. The system confirms all validations pass.
6. The system allows the submission workflow to proceed (e.g., store/record the submission and confirm submission success).

## Extensions
* **2a**: Required fields are missing (blanks)  
    * **2a1**: The system displays an error message identifying missing required fields.
    * **2a2**: The system blocks final submission until required fields are completed.
* **3a**: Contact email is invalid  
    * **3a1**: The system displays an error message indicating the email format is invalid.
    * **3a2**: The system blocks final submission until a valid email is provided.
* **4a**: Manuscript file is missing  
    * **4a1**: The system displays an error message indicating a manuscript file is required.
    * **4a2**: The system blocks final submission until a file is uploaded/selected.
* **4b**: Manuscript file type is not accepted  
    * **4b1**: The system displays an error message listing accepted formats (PDF, Word, LaTeX).
    * **4b2**: The system blocks final submission until a valid file type is provided.
* **5a**: Multiple validation errors occur  
    * **5a1**: The system displays all relevant error messages at once (or clearly indicates each failing field).
    * **5a2**: The system blocks final submission until all issues are corrected.
* **2b**: Author chooses to save as draft despite validation issues (if draft saving is allowed)  
    * **2b1**: The author selects **Save Draft**.
    * **2b2**: The system saves the current submission state without requiring all final validations.
    * **2b3**: The system confirms the draft was saved.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: High (performed on every submission attempt)  
* **Open Issues**:  
  * Exact set of required fields and per-field constraints are not fully specified in the SRS.  
  * Whether draft saving bypasses some validations is not specified; this use case assumes draft saving is more permissive than final submission.  
  * Whether file size validation (≤7MB) is part of this validation step is not included in the user story, but may be validated elsewhere (e.g., UC-09).
