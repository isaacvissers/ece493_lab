# UC-25 Scenario Narratives — Receive Editor’s Decision (Accept/Reject)

This document provides fully dressed scenario narratives for the **main success scenario** and **each alternative path (extension)** in **UC-25: Receive editor’s decision**.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative (Happy Path)

An editor records a final decision for a submitted paper in the Conference Management System (CMS). The system stores the decision and updates the paper’s status to **Accepted** or **Rejected**.

After the decision is recorded, the CMS identifies the author(s) associated with the paper and determines the configured delivery method for decisions (for example, email notification and/or in-app notification). The system generates a decision notification containing the paper details and the decision outcome.

The CMS delivers the decision notification to the author. The author receives the notification and accesses the decision. If the author uses the in-app method, they log into CMS and open **My Submissions** (or the paper details page), where the system clearly displays the final decision and any decision notes/comments that the editor provided. If the author receives an email notification, they read the email and optionally follow a link back into CMS to view full details.

The author now knows whether the paper was accepted or rejected and can proceed accordingly.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 5a: Notification Service Fails (Email/In-App Cannot Be Delivered)

An editor records a final decision for a paper and the CMS stores it successfully. The system attempts to notify the author through the configured notification channel, but the notification service fails (for example, an email outage or in-app notification queue failure).

Even though the notification cannot be delivered, the decision remains stored in the system. The CMS ensures the author can still view the decision by logging into their account and checking **My Submissions**.

The system logs the notification failure for administrator review and may retry sending the notification later or allow a manual resend if supported. The author ultimately still has access to the decision through the CMS interface.

## Alternative Path Narrative — 3a: Author Email Is Missing or Invalid for Email Delivery

An editor records a decision for a paper and the CMS attempts to send the author an email notification. However, the author’s email address is missing or invalid.

The system cannot deliver the email notification. If the CMS supports in-app notifications, it falls back to in-app delivery so the author can still receive the decision inside the system. The CMS logs the issue and may prompt the author to update their profile email address for future communications.

The author can log into CMS and view the decision in **My Submissions** even though the email notification was not successfully sent.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6a: Author Not Authenticated When Viewing Decision In-App

An author attempts to view the editor’s decision in CMS, but they are not currently logged in (for example, their session has expired). When the author navigates to **My Submissions** or follows a link from a decision notification, the CMS detects that authentication is required.

The system prompts the author to log in. After successful login, the CMS returns the author to the submissions page or directly to the paper details view so they can see the decision without having to search again.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 6b: Author Attempts to View Decision for a Paper They Are Not Associated With

An author tries to view the decision for a paper that they are not associated with—either by guessing a URL, following a shared link, or attempting to access another author’s submission.

The CMS checks the author’s association with the paper and determines that they are not permitted to view that submission’s decision. The system denies access and displays an authorization error.

The CMS logs the unauthorized access attempt for administrator review. No decision information is revealed to the unauthorized user.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 2a: Decision Is Not Yet Published/Visible to Authors (Staged Release)

An editor records a final decision for a paper, but the CMS is configured to release decisions only at a scheduled publication time (for example, all decisions released at once). The system stores the decision internally but does not notify the author immediately.

When the author logs into CMS and checks **My Submissions**, the system shows the paper’s decision as **Pending** or **Not yet released**. The author cannot see the final outcome until the scheduled release time.

Once the publication time arrives, the CMS makes the decision visible to the author and sends notifications as configured. The author then receives and views the decision normally.

---

## Alternative Path Narrative — 7a: Decision Notes Are Not Available

An editor records a final decision for a paper but does not provide any decision notes/comments. The CMS stores the decision outcome and notifies the author.

When the author views the decision, the CMS displays the outcome (**Accepted** or **Rejected**) clearly. However, no decision notes are shown because none were provided. The author still receives the essential decision information and understands the result even without additional explanation.
