# Use Case UC-12: Save submission progress (draft)

**Goal in Context**: An author saves submission progress at any step so work is not lost before final submission, and the author can return later to continue editing and submit when ready.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Author (Registered User)  
**Secondary Actors**: CMS Database; File Storage Service (if a manuscript file is included in the draft)  
**Trigger**: The author selects **Save Draft** (or equivalent) while editing a submission.

## Success End Condition
* The current submission state (entered metadata and any uploaded manuscript file) is saved as a draft and can be reopened later with the saved content intact.

## Failed End Condition
* The draft is not saved, changes are lost or not recoverable, and the author receives an error message explaining why saving failed.

## Preconditions
* The author is logged in.
* The author is on the manuscript submission form (creating a new submission or editing an existing draft).
* The submission is in an editable state (not locked/finalized, if such a rule exists).

## Main Success Scenario
1. The author starts a new submission or opens an existing draft submission.
2. The author enters or edits submission information (metadata and/or manuscript file).
3. The author selects **Save Draft**.
4. The system captures the current state of the submission (all fields entered so far and any attached file).
5. The system stores the draft state in the database (and file storage if applicable).
6. The system displays a confirmation message indicating the draft was saved successfully.
7. Later, the author reopens the saved draft and the system displays the previously saved state so the author can continue editing.

## Extensions
* **3a**: Author saves with incomplete or invalid final-submission fields  
    * **3a1**: The system allows draft saving without requiring all final-submission validations to pass.
    * **3a2**: The system may warn the author that required fields are still incomplete for final submission.
* **5a**: Database/storage write fails while saving the draft  
    * **5a1**: The system displays an error message indicating the draft could not be saved at this time.
    * **5a2**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
    * **5a3**: The system does not overwrite the previous saved draft state.
* **2a**: Author is not authenticated (session expired)  
    * **2a1**: The system redirects the author to the login page.
    * **2a2**: After successful login, the system returns the author to the submission form.
    * **2a3**: The author must retry saving.
* **6a**: Confirmation message not displayed (UI feedback failure)  
    * **6a1**: The system still saves the draft successfully.
    * **6a2**: The system provides alternate confirmation (e.g., “Last saved at <time>” indicator).
* **7a**: Draft cannot be reopened (draft retrieval failure)  
    * **7a1**: The system displays an error message indicating the draft cannot be loaded at this time.
    * **7a2**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
    * **7a3**: The author is prevented from editing until retrieval succeeds.
