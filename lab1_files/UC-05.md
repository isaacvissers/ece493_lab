# Use Case UC-05: Log in to CMS

**Goal in Context**: A registered user authenticates using their username and password so they can access CMS features and their account-specific functionality.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Registered User (Authorized User)  
**Secondary Actors**: CMS Database  
**Trigger**: The registered user selects the option to log in to CMS.

## Success End Condition
* The user is authenticated successfully and redirected to their home page with access to CMS features.

## Failed End Condition
* The user is not authenticated, remains unable to access protected CMS features, and receives an error message explaining the failure.

## Preconditions
* The user has a registered account in CMS.
* The user is not currently logged in.
* The CMS login page is available.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The registered user requests to log in to the system.
2. The system prompts the user to enter their username and password.
3. The user enters their username and password.
4. The user submits the login request.
5. The system compares the provided credentials with the stored credentials in the database.
6. The system authenticates the user successfully.
7. The system redirects the user to their home page.

## Extensions
* **3a**: User leaves username or password blank  
    * **3a1**: The system displays an error message indicating required fields are missing.
    * **3a2**: The system prevents authentication until both fields are provided.
* **5a**: Username does not exist  
    * **5a1**: The system displays an error message indicating the credentials are invalid.
    * **5a2**: The system prevents access and allows the user to try again.
* **5b**: Password does not match the stored password  
    * **5b1**: The system displays an error message indicating the credentials are invalid.
    * **5b2**: The system prevents access and allows the user to try again.
* **5c**: Database lookup fails  
    * **5c1**: The system displays an error message indicating login cannot be completed at this time.
    * **5c2**: The system logs the failure for administrator review.
    * **5c3**: The system prevents access until the issue is resolved.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: High (occurs whenever registered users access CMS)  
* **Open Issues**:  
  * Whether usernames are distinct from emails is not explicitly defined; the SRS uses “username” but registration is described using email.  
  * Account lockout, retry limits, and password reset behavior are not specified.
